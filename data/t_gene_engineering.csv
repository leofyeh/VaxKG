26,101,18,27,Protein,"Tumor suppressor protein p53, a nuclear protein, plays an essential role in the regulation of cell cycle, specifically in the transition from G0 to G1. It is found in very low levels in normal cells; however, in a variety of transformed cell lines, it is expressed in high amounts and is believed to contribute to transformation and malignancy. p53 is a DNA-binding protein containing DNA-binding, oligomerization, and transcription activation domains. It is postulated to bind as a tetramer to a p53-binding site and activate expression of downstream genes that inhibit growth and/or invasion and thus function as a tumor suppressor. Mutants of p53 that frequently occur in a number of different human cancers fail to bind the consensus DNA binding site and hence cause the loss of tumor suppressor activity. Alterations of the TP53 gene occur not only as somatic mutations in human malignancies, but also as germline mutations in some cancer-prone families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [Ref146:Ober et al., 2002].",p53,10

A 14 aa extension comprising the FLAG epitope and KDEL ER retention signal, and flanking Bsp120 restriction sites were introduced by PCR. The final sequence encoded a 137 aa protein of 15.5 kDa that yielded a 13.3 kDa LTB-FLAG protein after signal peptide cleavage. Following subcloning into pGEM T/A (Promega) for sequence verification, the Bsp120 LTB gene fragment was subcloned into the pGly vector, placing it under the control of soybean seed-specific glycinin promoter and terminator [35]. The final soybean transformation vector pGly::ER-LTB contained a hygromycin selection marker (kindly provided by N.

LT is a hetero-oligomeric AB5 type enterotoxin composed of a 27 kDa A subunit with toxic ADP ribosyl transferase activity and a stable noncovalent-linked pentamer of 11.6 kDa B subunits. ETEC infection and colonization of the small intestine, and the production of LT, causes acute diarrhea that can be fatal without intervention. The ADP-ribosylation of GsÎ±, catalyzed by the A subunit, triggers increased intracellular cAMP levels that induce chloride efflux and fluid loss from intoxicated cells lining the small intestine. The B subunit pentamer mediates holotoxin binding to ganglioside GM1 on intestinal epithelial cells, with lower affinity for GD1B, asialoGM1 and lactosylceramide gangliosides [Ref212:Moravec et al., 2007].",Synthetic plant codo-optimized LTB gene,10

In brief, a speciï¬c, in-frame deletion mutation in the guaBA operon was ï¬rst introduced, followed by a second in-frame deletion mutation in the plasmid virulence gene virG. The chromosomal mutation set was accomplished with
deletion of 85% of subunit A of set. Finally, a sen cassette was constructed by fusing two 700-bp segments that include the N and C termini of sen minus 300 bp corresponding to the putative active site in the N-terminal region. The ars operon, conferring resistance to arsenite, was cloned into the sen locus to allow facile transfer of the double-deletion mutation (virG and sen) virulence plasmid to candidate Shigella vaccine strains and as a marker to distinguish CVD 1207 in the ï¬eld.  As previously described, CVD 1207 does not grow in minimum medium unless supplemented with guanine. The lack of enterotoxic activity has been conï¬rmed in Ussing chambers.

Producing strain CVD 1205 took many steps and began with construction of the guaB-A deletion cassette pFM726A. In the construction of the guaB-A deletion cassette, DNA segments that included the 59 terminus of guaB and the 39 terminus of guaA were ampliï¬ed (from S. ï¬‚exneri 2a strain 2457T genomic DNA) and fused by PCR, originating the guaB-A allele. With the internal primers (primers 2 and 3) was introduced an in-frame stop sign upstream of two unique restriction sites that were added for the future introduction of foreign genes into the chromosomal DguaB-A allele. The external primers (primers 1 and 4) were designed to introduce unique restriction sites that were used to clone the guaB-A allele into the temperature-sensitive, pSC101-based suicide plasmid pFM307A, originating pFM726A. The same external primers were used to amplify the wild-type guaB-A operon (from strain 2457T), which was subsequently cloned in pGEM-T, yielding pGEM::gua, and in pFM307A, yielding pFM215A.

At the day of immunization the peptides (0.3 mg/peptide) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration 20%) admixed with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and emulsified with an equal volume of Montanide ISA-51 (Seppic).
