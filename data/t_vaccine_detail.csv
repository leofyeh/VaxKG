Therefore, inhibition of the binding and entry of the toxin complex, particularly lethal toxin, into the host cell is clearly important for the prevention of infection.

The vaccine caused severe side-effects and was discontinued, although the HalTkine Institute now produces a formaldehyde-killed preparation of strain 195/P [Ref72:Russell et al., 1995]. It was not until 1946 that a killed whole cells vaccine was developed for use in man. Various methods of killing the bacterial cells have been used, including formaldehyde and heat treatment. The vaccine is currently produced by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Australia and is usually given as a course of three doses over a period of two months[Ref53:Titball et al., 2001]. The vaccine currently used in the USA and in the UK is the Plague vaccine, USP (Cutter Biological), a formaldehyde-killed preparation of the highly virulent 195/P strain of Y pestis [Ref72:Russell et al., 1995].There are no definitive clinical trials which demonstrate the efficacy of killed whole cell vaccines. However, studies in several animal species have demonstrated protection against bubonic plague. Also there is circumstantial evidence for the efficacy of the vaccine in humans derived from data on the incidence of bubonic plague in immunised US servicemen serving in Vietnam during the period 1961â€“1971. It is possible that differences in the lifestyles of servicemen and Vietnamese civilians were responsible for the reduced incidence of plague in the former group. Evidence for the efficacy of killed whole cells vaccines for the prevention of pneumonic plague is less conclusive. Cases of pneumonic plague have been reported in individuals immunised with this vaccine. More recently it has been shown that mice immunised with this vaccine are protected against subcutaneous challenge, but not against inhalation challenge with Y. pestis. Together, these findings suggest that killed whole cell vaccines do not induce a response which provides protection against pneumonic plague [Ref53:Titball et al., 2001].

The dually active anthrax vaccine (DAAV) confers simultaneous protection against both bacilli and toxins was highly sought after through research. The weakly immunogenic and antiphagocytic PGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveillance in a similar manner to the role of capsular polysaccharides in protecting pathogens, such as pneumococci and meningococci. Encapsulated B. anthracis strains grow unimpeded in the infected host, whereas isolates lacking the capsule are phagocytized and are virtually avirulent. Anthrax toxins are formed by PA, lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF), which are secreted separately as nontoxic monomers. The binding of LF or EF to PA results in the formation of active lethal toxin (LT) or edema toxin (ET), respectively. Because of its ability to elicit a protective immune response against both anthrax toxins, PA is the target antigen of existing anthrax vaccine. However, a vaccine based on both PGA and PA might allow direct targeting of bacillar growth, as well as inhibiting toxin activity, making it more effective than a vaccine based on PA alone. PGA is an attractive antigen because it consists of d-glutamic acid residues linked by Î³ peptide bonds, and thus bears no resemblance to mammalian host molecules [Ref26: Rhie et al., 2003].","This conjugate vaccine is constructed by conjugating two major virulence factors of B. anthracis, the capsular poly-Î³-D-glutamic acid (PGA) and the essential toxin component and protective antigen (PA).

The V antigen of Y. pestis is a secreted protein that is thought to act both as a regulatory protein and as a virulence factor. The V antigen has a key role in the Type III secretion process utilised by Y. pestis to translocate cytotoxic and anti-phagocytic Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) into the host cell. Supporting evidence for this role has been gained and the V antigen has been visualised on the bacterial cell surface [Ref52:Jones et al., 2003].  
Both the rF1 and rV proteins, administered in alhydrogel, have been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and protective against virulent plague in a number of animal models: mice, guinea pigs, and cynomolgus macaques (unpublished data). Further, the combination of rF1 plus rV is additive in the protection conferred on the vaccinee. In the mouse, the combined immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) titer to rF1 plus rV has been shown to correlate with protection against challenge. Further, protection against plague in the mouse has been demonstrated by the passive transfer of antiserum specific for rF1 plus rV from immunized BALB/c mice into naÃ¯ve SCID/beige mice [Ref61:Williamson et al., 2005]. ","The rF1 and rV antigens were produced in Escherichia coli from the expression systems previously described, under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. The vaccine was formulated by adsorption to 20% (vol/vol) adjuvant at the required concentrations of each protein such that concentrations in the range 10 Âµg rF1 + 10 Âµg rV per ml up to 80 Âµg rF1 + 80 Âµg rV per ml were achieved in a final concentration of 0.26% (wt/vol) alhydrogel to achieve a molar ratio for rF1 to rV of 2:1.

Reactogenicity varied with the host animal and the route of inoculation. For instance, such strains are virulent for mice by the intravenous (i.v.) route but attenuated by peripheral routes of infection, and several species of non-human primates are significantly more sensitive to Pgmâˆ’ Y. pestis than are guinea pigs.

Thus, a new vaccine for plague based on the protective protein sub-units capsular Fraction 1 (Caf1) and LcrV is under development.  The Caf1 molecule is a temperature-regulated capsular protein of Y. pestis which is maximally expressed at 37 Â°C and which has a role in resistance of phagocytosis. The LcrV antigen of Y. pestis is a 37 kDa secreted protein that is known to have a role in modulation of host defence mechanisms by down-regulating production of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± and and up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. It is also believed to act as a virulence factor with a key role in the Type III secretion system of Y. pestis. Immunisation with recombinant LcrV antigen adsorbed to the adjuvant alhydrogel has been shown to confer protection against virulent challenge by both the sub-cutaneous and airborne routes. The use of the rCaf1 and rLcrV subunits in combination has been shown to have an additive effect on protection in murine models of infection and the two sub-units when formulated with alhydrogel are being taken forward into clinical trials as a vaccine for human use [Ref59: Elvin et al., 2006]","Recombinant Caf1 antigen was produced in Escherichia coli strain JM101 containing plasmid pAH34L, encoding the caf operon of Y. pestis strain GB.

The chemical composition of the lipid A moiety of LVS LPS is quite different from that of enteric LPS. The LVS LPS lacks a functional lipid A. This apparently confers a survival advantage on the bacterium, since its LPS does not participate in induction of nitric oxide production that might limit its intracellular growth. Further, since other data indicate that LVS LPS is unable to block macrophage stimulation by functional LPS, the structure must be distinct enough to not permit recognition as an antagonist for traditional LPSs. The ability of LVS LPS to stimulate protection in C3H/HeJ mice, which are defective in the ability to recognize and respond to enteric LPS at least in part due to a point mutation in Toll-like receptor 4, suggests that LVS LPS is recognized through receptors other than Tlr4 [Ref70:Dreisbach et al., 2000].",,"",,"","Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) LPS is purified from whole F. tularensis LVS bacteria.

Topologically, these neurotoxins are composed of three domains: binding, translocation, and catalytic, each of which is believed to play a role in intoxication. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain is responsible for binding nerve cell receptor(s). After toxin binding, it is thought to be internalized into an endosome through receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is believed that the 50-kDa amino-terminal domain of the heavy chain possesses channel-forming capabilities when in the acidic environment of the endosome, allowing internalization of the toxin. The final step in the mechanism involves zinc-dependent proteolysis by the catalytic domain of key cytosolic substrates necessary for neurotransmitter release [Ref107:Byrne et al., 1998]. ","After fermentation and cell disruption, BoNT/A(Hc) was purified by using a three-step chromatographic process consisting of expanded-bed chromatography, Mono S cation-exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography [Ref107:Byrne et al., 1998].","[Ref107:Byrne et al., 1998]",,10,
75,75,14,Toxoid vaccine,,,"",,"Currently, a pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) against serotypes A-E is used to immunize specific populations of at-risk individuals. The manufacture of PBT, by the Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH), took place in stages and over many years. The fermentation, isolation, purification and detoxification steps for each serotype took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The monovalent bulks were completed in 1971, and first packaged in 1978. Investigational New Drug (IND) status was granted for the PBT under the CDC's IND 161 (at risk workers) and under the United States Army's Office of Surgeon General IND 3723 (for military deployment). The MDPH product was studied and used as an investigational vaccine from 1979 until the present time.
An effort is ongoing on the part of the US Army to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure for the PBT lots PBP003 and PBP004. For licensure of the PBT, FDA required that a pivotal clinical trial be performed to re-evaluate safety and assess immunogenicity of the toxoid,and that a new lot of toxoid be manufactured to demonstrate reproducibility and robustness of the manufacturing process and consistency of the manufactured product. The final report on the pivotal clinical study was expected in June 2000. This study will have evaluated, in a significant number of participants, the protective immunogenicity of all 5 serotype vaccines with respect to their homologous neurotoxins. Results from this pivotal study and the status of a new-generation, recombinant vaccine will be factors in deciding whether to proceed with a new lot of toxoid [Ref109: Byrne et al., 2000].","The toxoid was manufactured by initially culturing C. botulinum serotypes A-E to produce crude preparations of neurotoxins. The toxins were separated from the culture fluid by acid precipitation overnight in the cold then separated from the supernatant fluid by filtration and/or centrifugation. The precipitated toxin was washed, extracted, and filtered to remove any particulate material.  Toxins were again precipitated, filter-sterilized, and detoxified by adding formalin. Residual formalin was left in the vaccine products to ensure that the neurotoxins remained non-toxic. Monovalent vaccines were then adsorbed to the adjuvant and blended into a pentavalent vaccine [Ref109: Byrne et al., 2000].","Even though toxoid vaccines are available, there are numerous shortcomings with their current use and ease of production. First, because C. botulinum is a spore-former, a dedicated facility is required to manufacture a toxin-based product. The requirement for a dedicated manufacturing facility is not trivial. It is extremely costly to renovate and upgrade an existing facility or to build a new one and then to maintain the facility in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) to manufacture one vaccine. Second, the yields of toxin production from C. botulinum are relatively low. Third, the toxoiding process involves handling large quantities of toxin and thus is dangerous, and the added safety precautions increase the cost of manufacturing. Fourth, the toxoid product for types A-E consists of a crude extract of clostridial proteins that may influence immunogenicity or reactivity of the vaccine, and the type F toxoid is only partially purified (IND 5077). Fifth, because the toxoiding process involves the use of formaldehyde, which inactivates the toxin, and residual levels of formaldehyde (not to exceed 0.02%) are part of the product formulation to prevent reactivation of the toxin, the vaccine is reactogenic. An additional component of the toxoid vaccines is the preservative thimerosal (0.01%), which also increases the reactogenicity of the product [Ref109: Byrne et al., 2000].",,10,

After ribonuclease treatment, the toxin was further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and repeated fractionation on fast liquid column chromatography on a fast flow Q Sepharose column.  Unlike the toxoid (estimated toxoid purity of 10%), the purity of the type F botulinum toxoid Lot no. 002/90 was greater than 60% (IND 5077).

78,78,14,Subunit vaccine,,,"",,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are a group of seven (Aâ€“G) antigenically distinct proteins produced by Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacillus found in soil and marine sediments from all parts of the world. BoNTs inhibit the release of acetylcholine (ACH) at the synapse of motor neurons, which initially causes muscle weakness, progressing to flaccid paralysis, subsequent ventilatory failure, and death. This can happen at very low concentrations of BoNT (10âˆ’9 g/kg), making the toxin one of the most potent poisons known.The most common exposures to BoNT are food-borne, infant, and wound botulism. The likely mode of delivery of BoNT in bio-warfare or terrorist scenarios is through aerosol delivery. Toxicity from BoNT can be lethal without early detection and intensive supportive therapy. Trivalent equine-based antitoxins (A, B, and E) are available and are used clinically to neutralize and clear BoNT from the circulatory system. A number of different products have been proposed as candidate vaccines against BoNT. For BoNT to express its deleterious effects, sequential mechanistic events are carried out by three discrete structural domains of the protein. The BoNT exert toxicity only after they bind specifically to a neuron receptor at the neuromuscular junction. This receptor-toxin complex is then internalized within a vesicle followed by translocation of a portion of the toxin into the neuronal cytosol. This part of the molecule is responsible for the inherent toxicity that arises from its endoprotease activity on neurovesicle transport proteins. Once enzymatically inactivated by the toxin, these ""SNARE"" proteins cannot facilitate ACH-containing neurovesicles docking to the plasma membrane at the neuromuscular junction. This inhibits the vesicle from expelling its contents (ACH) into the synaptic space. The different toxin events are brought about by distinct protein domains of the holotoxin that are nearly equal in mass, which have been structurally and functionally defined. The holotoxin, approximately 150 kDa, consists of a heavy chain (approximately 100 kDa) that extends from the carboxy terminus to a disulfide bridge where the light chain (approximately 50 kDa) is attached. The receptor-binding domain is found in the carboxy portion of the heavy chain known as the C fragment or HC region. The remaining fragment of the heavy chain is known as the HN and, with the carboxy terminus of the light chain, spans the disulfide bridge to comprise the translocation domain, which facilitates light-chain entry into the neuronal cytoplasm. The light chain contains the zinc-dependent endoprotease domain responsible for inactivating docking proteins, inhibiting exocytosis, and the inherent toxicity of BoNT. Because BoNT toxicity is neuro-specific and enzymatic, while substrate is limited, relatively few molecules of BoNT are necessary to inhibit neurovesicle docking and expulsion. A number of regions of the BoNT have been investigated and cloned for potential use as immunogens for recombinant vaccine candidates A and B serotypes. The C fragment of BoNT was a logical choice for a vaccine candidate based on its native function, immunogenicity, and lack of observed signs of toxicity [Ref110:Boles et al., 2006].","Purified rBoNTB(Hc) vaccine (Lot No. 0490) was produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices at the Department of Biologics Research, Pilot Bio-Production Facility, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Forest Glen, MD.

81,81,11,Protein,,,"",,"Due to the severity of plague and its potential for use as a bioweapon, better preventatives and therapeutics for plague are desirable. Subunit vaccines directed against the F1 capsular antigen and the V antigen (also known as LcrV) of Y. pestis are under development. However, these new vaccine formulations have some possible limitations: the F1 antigen is not required for full virulence of Y. pestis and LcrV has a demonstrated immunosuppressive effect. These limitations could damper the ability of F1/LcrV based vaccines to protect against F1-minus Y. pestis strains and could lead to a high rate of undesired side effects in vaccinated populations. Thus, the use of other antigens in a plague vaccine formulation may be advantageous. Desired features in vaccine candidates would be antigens that are conserved, essential for virulence and accessible to circulating antibody. Several of the proteins required for the construction or function of the type III secretion system (TTSS) complex could be ideal contenders to meet the desired features of a vaccine candidate. Accordingly, the TTSS needle complex protein, YscF, was selected to investigate its potential as a protective antigen [Ref113:Matson et al., 2005].","To facilitate its purification, YscF was cloned into the overexpression plasmid pET24b (Novagen) to yield a hexahistidine-tag on the C-terminus of YscF (HT-YscF).

Clinical trials have been conducted using the NYCBH-derived ACAM2000 vaccinia virus-based vaccine. On the basis of animal studies, ACAM2000 is believed to be less neurovirulent than Dryvax. ACAM2000 was similar to Dryvax in its ability to induce immune responses and in reactogenicity in phase I trials. During phase II and phase III clinical trials, cases of myopericarditis were associated with both ACAM2000 and Dryvax in vaccinia-naive volunteers [Ref135:Parrino et al., 2006].","ACAM2000 was prepared from ACAM1000 master seed stock and produced in Vero cells to address the need for rapid large-scale vaccine production [Ref135:Parrino et al., 2006]. 
Specifically, ACAM2000 was manufactured by infecting Vero cells grown on microcarriers under serum-free conditions with the P9 production virus inoculum at an MOI of 0.01â€“0.2. Virus particles were purified and concentrated. The resulting concentrated bulk vaccine was formulated by dilution with a buffer containing stabilizers to a final potency of 1.0â€“5.0 Ã— 10^8 pfu/mL, filled into vials containing 0.3 mL [Ref144: Monath et al., 2004].","It has long been known that vaccinia strains differ with respect to neurovirulence in infant mice. Clones 1, 3, and 5 and the uncloned virus had virulence properties that were unacceptable for consideration as vaccine candidates. The same four viruses that had exhibited excessive virulence in rabbit skin were significantly more neurovirulent than Dryvax1 (p < 0.05, Kaplanâ€”Meier survival distribution, log rank test), whereas clones 2, 4, and 6 were similar to Dryvax1 or less virulent. The more virulent viruses also replicated to higher titer in mouse brain. In these initial experiments Clone 2 did not appear to be attenuated with respect to neurovirulence, but subsequent studies with larger numbers of animals showed significantly higher survival distribution compared to Dryvax1. Clone 2 (renamed ACAM1000) was selected as the candidate for further development, based on its similarity to Dryvax1 in pock formation in rabbit skin but its lower neurovirulence in mice and monkeys. Seed viruses and vaccine produced from each bioreactor run were tested for neurovirulence in suckling mice, using Dryvax1 as a comparator. Plaque-purified vaccinia virus lines were shown to differ significantly in neurovirulence for mice, in their ability to evoke immune responses against the inserted gene product, and in their HindIII restriction maps. The variant viruses often exhibit reduced infectivity and reduced virulence for mice. We found biological and molecular heterogeneity among 6 clones derived from Dryvax1, with some clonal subpopulations (e.g. Clone 3) having dramatically higher virulence and changes at the genomic level. The degree of neurovirulence for suckling mice was used to distinguish vaccine strains with low, moderate, or high pathogenicity [Ref163:Vilesova et al., 1985]. The new vaccine has advantages over first generation vaccines, since it has been produced to modern manufacturing and control standards, is free from adventitious agents , and does not contain subpopulations of virus with undesirable virulence properties [Ref144:Monath et al., 2004].
In addition, mice immunized with MVA were protected against lethal infection with a more virulent form of vaccinia virus altered to coexpress IL-4. IL-4 diminishes the cytolytic capacity of CD81 T cells, resulting in delayed viral clearance and increased virulence [Ref135:Parrino et al., 2006].

Together, these results provide the proof of concept, in macaque models that mirror human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection, that a prime-boost approach with a highly attenuated poxvirus followed by Dryvax increases the safety of smallpox vaccination, and they highlight the importance of neutralizing antibodies in protection against virulent poxvirus [Ref161:Edghill-Smith et al., 2003].","NYVAC was derived from the Copenhagen strain and developed by selective deletion of 18 open reading frames (ORFs) [Ref135:Parrino et al., 2006].","[Ref165:Belyakov et al., 2003][Ref164:Edghill-Smith et al., 2003]",,10,

Passaging in mammalian cells increases virulence in mammals, resulting in new MVA-like strains with unknown safety profiles in humans. The resulting viruses grow exclusively in a complementing permanent cell line, excluding reversion to virulence and obviating the need for primary cells. The WR strain is a vaccinia virus laboratory strain passaged in mouse brain that has unfavorable properties, such as neurovirulence and gonadotropism, not suitable for clinical use. The large deletions characteristic for MVA seemed to suggest that the restriction in host range and virulence was mainly due to these deletions, including the loss of a host range gene and many immune modulatory genes. It will be interesting to see whether an MVA strain first adapted to growth in mammalian cells and then passaged in mouse brain also regains virulence. In contrast to MVA, dVVs with an essential gene deleted cannot regain replication and virulence functions upon passaging in a chosen host. Reversion to virulence can principally be excluded because the vector lacks an essential gene, which restricts its host range to a complementing cell line [Ref146:Ober et al., 2002].",,10,

EHEC strains produce intimin, an outer membrane adhesin encoded by the eae gene located in a chromosomal pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement. Intimin mediates intimate bacterial attachment to enterocytes by binding to Tir, a bacterial protein which is translocated into host cells by a LEE-encoded type III secretion system. Intimin can also bind in vitro to Î²1-integrins and cell-surface localised nucleolin and these proteins can be detected proximal to adherent EHEC O157:H7 in vivo. Intimin is a key colonisation factor for EHEC O157:H7 in neonatal calves, young and weaned calves and adult cattle and sheep. In addition, intimin influences the carriage and virulence of EHEC O157:H7 in streptomycin pre-treated mice, infant rabbits and gnotobiotic and neonatal piglets. Another factor influencing colonisation of the bovine intestines is EHEC factor for adherence (Efa-1). Non-O157 EHEC, including serotype O26:H-, contain a full-length copy of efa-1 while EHEC O157:H7 contains a truncated form which is predicted to encode the amino-terminal 433 amino acids of the protein (efa-1â€²). Mutation of efa-1 in EHEC serotypes O5:H- and O111:H- significantly reduced faecal excretion and bacterial adherence to the colonic epithelium in experimentally infected calves. Antibodies directed against the central and carboxyl-terminal portions of Efa-1 label the bacterial surface and inhibit adherence of rabbit enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) to cultured epithelial cells and this may indicate that Efa-1 is an adhesin. However, efa-1 mutations in EHEC O5:H- and O111:H- indirectly impair the expression and secretion of type III secreted proteins encoded by the LEE that are known to influence intestinal colonisation. Mutation of the truncated efa-1 gene of EHEC O157:H7 impaired adherence to cultured cells but did not significantly impair intestinal colonisation of calves [Ref208:van et al., 2007].","Proteins were expressed in E. coli K-12 strain BL21 (DE3) Star cells which lack RNaseE to stabilise mRNA.

The presence of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring motif sequentially affected total circumsporozoite protein production, cellular distribution, antigen processing and secretion, leading to less effective antigen presentation. Consistently, vaccination with an adenovirus recombinant carrying the anchoring motif-disrupted circumsporozoite gene, resulted in significant increase of the number of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) producing T cells and specific IgG2a isotype antibodies, ensuing more effective vaccination. Given that the anchoring motif is highly conserved among different species of Plasmodium, anti-malaria subunit vaccines encoded by recombinant vectors that aim at the induction of strong cellular immunity could maximize immunogenicity by removing anchoring motifs [Ref481:Bruna-Romero et al., 2004].","The VR1020 DNA vaccine plasmid was modified to contain the Pfs230 region C (1327â€“3396 bp).
