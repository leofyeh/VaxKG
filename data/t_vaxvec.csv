37,NYVAC vaccine vector,,"A NYVAC vaccine vector allows for gene expression on a high level and generates antigen-specific immune responses when administered to animals and humans [Ref2979:Perdiguero et al., 2013].","A NYVAC vector still contains other viral genes that are immunomodulatory that may repress host immunity, notably genes coding for proteins that antagonize the innate immune response mediated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling.  It also remains uncertain that long-term existence of protective immune response will be generated when NYVAC is administered. It has been documented that antibody titers induced by NYVAC for small pox disease were significantly lower than the traditional vaccines. Moreover, NYVAC immunized subjects exhibited qualitative differences in the immune response, resulting in the failure in the induction of antigen-specific antibodies [Ref2979:Perdiguero et al., 2013].","NYVAC is a highly attenuated vaccinia strain [Ref3232:Tartaglia et al., 1992].

An AcMNPV construct that contains a deletion of the gp64 gene is unable to propagate infection from cell to cell, and this defect results from both a severe reduction in the production of budded virions and the absence of GP64 on virions [Ref3024:Zhou and Blissard, 2008].",,,VO_0001082,Autographa californica multicapsid Nucleopolyhedrovirus vaccine vector is a member of the baculovirus family.
