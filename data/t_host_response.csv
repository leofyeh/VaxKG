Active immunization of mice with PAV protected against 1,000 minimum lethal doses of intravenously injected Lcr1 cells of Y. pestis. The progressive necrosis provoked by Lcr1 cells of Y. pestis in visceral organs of nonimmunized mice was replaced after active immunization with PAV by massive infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells (which generated protective granulomas indistinguishable from those formed against avirulent Lcr2 mutants in nonimmunized mice).

In addition, the rBoNTB(HC) vaccine candidate produced SNA titers that were protective for at least the monkeys at 14 week from the first phase, whether these same or higher titers are protective for the second phase monkeys up to 2 years was not assessed [Ref110: Boles et al., 2006].","All rhesus monkeys inoculated with either 1 or 5 Î¼g of rBoNTB(Hc) survived the aerosol challenge at 14 weeks after the first injection [Ref110: Boles et al., 2006].","Daily observations by the veterinary staff revealed no adverse reactions to the recombinant vaccine itself, consistent with the findings of other studies evaluating rBoNT(HC) vaccines for other serotypes [Ref110:Boles et al., 2006].",,"A number of different products have been proposed as candidate vaccines against BoNT and some, including BoNTB(Hc), use a development strategy based on known structure activity relationships. For BoNT to express its deleterious effects, sequential mechanistic events are carried out by three discrete structural domains of the protein. The BoNT exert toxicity only after they bind specifically to a neuron receptor at the neuromuscular junction. This receptor-toxin complex is then internalized within a vesicle followed by translocation of a portion of the toxin into the neuronal cytosol. This part of the molecule is responsible for the inherent toxicity that arises from its endoprotease activity on neurovesicle transport proteins. Once enzymatically inactivated by the toxin, the SNARE proteins cannot facilitate ACH-containing neurovesicles docking to the plasma membrane at the neuromuscular junction. This, in effect, inhibits the vesicle from expelling its contents (ACH) into the synaptic space.

The different toxin events are brought about by distinct protein domains of the holotoxin that are nearly equal in mass, which have been structurally and functionally defined. The holotoxin, approximately 150 kDa, consists of a heavy chain (approximately 100 kDa) that extends from the carboxy terminus to a disulfide bridge where the light chain (approximately 50 kDa) is attached. The receptor-binding domain is found in the carboxy portion of the heavy chain known as the C fragment or HC region. The remaining fragment of the heavy chain is known as the HN and, with the carboxy terminus of the light chain, spans the disulfide bridge to comprise the translocation domain, which facilitates light-chain entry into the neuronal cytoplasm. The light chain contains the zinc-dependent endoprotease domain responsible for inactivating docking proteins, inhibiting exocytosis, and the inherent toxicity of BoNT. Because BoNT toxicity is neuro-specific and enzymatic, while substrate is limited, relatively few molecules of BoNT are necessary to inhibit neurovesicle docking and expulsion [Ref110: Boles et al., 2006].",10,0,,,,,,

In plasma, the recombinant virus was not detectable by plaque assay or by biological amplification. Recombinant viral RNA was not detectable by RT/PCR in 140 Î¼l of plasma extracted on days 4, 10, and 21. However, when RNA samples were prepared from 0.5 ml of total blood, an RT/PCR assay gave a strong positive signal on day 4 after YFV17D/ LAS-GPC inoculation. Still, blood samples collected on day 10 and 21 were PCR negative. Viral RNA sequences were only transiently detectable on days 7â€“14 in spleen and liver. Nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR products confirmed their derivation from YFV17D/LAS-GPC. Taken together, these data confirm that recombinant YF17D/LAS-GPC replicated poorly in tissues of vaccinated guinea pigs. Interestingly, in clinical trials in individuals vaccinated with chimeric YFV17D-based vaccines, viremia levels were even lower than the levels of YFV17D determined to be safe. This suggests that insertion of a foreign gene can affect in vivo viral replication and make recombinant YFV17D-based vaccines even safer than the parental vaccine, YFV17D [Ref137:Bredenbeek et al., 2006].",10,0,,,,,,

The military vaccination program included vaccination for smallpox epidemic response teams (2000-5000 people) to assist with epidemic control and contact tracing in an outbreak, medical teams for hospitals and clinics (10,000-25,000 people) to care for smallpox cases, and operational forces (up to 500,000 people) to preserve critical capabilities. The licensed full-strength smallpox vaccine containing the NYCBH strain of vaccinia was used. First-time vaccination entailed punctures with a bifurcated needle. Previous vaccinees received 15 punctures. Those who did not respond with a major reaction as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) were vaccinated again. Smallpox vaccinations began at 4 pilot sites: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX; and the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD.

112,2,97,"",18,Healthy adults age 18-65 years,"The study was a randomized, blind single-center comparative trial in healthy adult volunteers. Cohorts 1-4 were randomly assigned equivalent doses (2Â·5Ã—105 plaque-forming units [pfu]) of either CCSV or Dryvax in a double-blind fashion. Participants were stratified by previous exposure to vaccinia (naive vs non-naive) and randomly assigned to vaccine group with a computer-generated process. In the vaccinia-naive group, a ratio of 2 to 1 (CCSV to Dryvax) was used, whereas in the non-naive population, the ratio was 1 to 1. All cohorts were enrolled consecutively with at least a 21-day delay between vaccination of successive cohorts. Cohorts 1-3 consisted of 15, 45, and 90 vaccinia-naive individuals, respectively (100 assigned CCSV and 50 Dryvax). Cohort four consisted of 100 non-naive individuals (50 CCSV and 50 Dryvax). Doses in cohort five (vaccinia-naive) were single-blind (to volunteer only) to one of the following five dilutions of CCSV (20 per group, CCSV to diluent): undiluted, 1:5, 1:10, 1:25, and 1:50. A random subset of 60 volunteers from cohort three (40 CCSV and 20 Dryvax) and 40 volunteers from cohort four (20 from each group) had blood samples taken for testing of cell-mediated immune responses [Ref141:Greenberg et al., 2005].",percutaneous (scarification),"Participants kept a daily diary of symptoms and body temperature for the first 2 weeks after vaccination, and returned to the clinic for follow-up on days 3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 28, 45, 60, and 180 after vaccination. In vaccinia-naive individuals, titres peaked on day 28, whereas in non-naive people, they peaked on day 14. Although PRN50 geometric mean titres were generally higher for recipients of Dryvax rather than CCSV, their overall patterns on days 14, 28, 60, and 180 after vaccination did not differ significantly between the two vaccine groups for either vaccinia-naive or non-naive individuals [Ref141:Greenberg et al., 2005].","The take rate was 100% for all volunteers who received undiluted CCSV, irrespective of previous vaccinia-exposure. The 95% CI of the point estimate for vaccinia-naive individuals was 96â€“100% for CCSV; similarly, the 95% CI for vaccinia-non-naive individuals was 93%â€“100%. CCSV was immunogenic in vaccine-naive volunteers at a dose 50 times lower than that approved for Dryvax. CCSV seems to be a safe and immunogenic alternative to calf-lymph derived vaccine for both vaccinia-naive and non-naive people [Ref141:Greenberg et al., 2005].","349 (99Â·7%) of 350 volunteers developed pock lesions; one vaccinia-naive individual who received a 1 in 25 dilution of CCSV did not. The rate of adverse events related to vaccine and the extent of humoral and cellular immune responses did not differ between the vaccine groups in vaccinia-naive or non-naive people. During clinic visits in the first 28 days, individuals were assessed for adverse events (vital signs, diary inspection, and concomitant medication) and formation of pock lesions (pock lesion inspection, measurements, and photographs). Intensity of adverse events was classified as mild (awareness of signs and symptoms that are easily tolerated), moderate (signs and symptoms produce discomfort sufficient to interfere with, but not prevent, normal daily activities), or severe (signs and symptoms produce sufficient discomfort to prevent normal daily activities). Differences between two proportions (eg, proportion with adverse events or proportion testing positive by an immunological assay). No serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported. Nobody withdrew from the study because of an adverse event. Other than rashes, no notable differences in frequency or severity of adverse events were recorded in the group receiving undiluted CCSV compared with those receiving diluted CCSV, and there were no notable differences in frequency of adverse events in the 1 in 50 group compared with those in other dilution groups. The adverse events reported for both vaccines were similar in severity and frequency, indicating that the manufacturing process in early human testing did not select for a more reactogenic vaccine, although it never entered larger clinical trials. As expected, vaccinia-non-naive participants tended to have fewer and milder adverse events than their vaccinia-naive counterparts. Overall, the adverse events in the diluted cohort were consistent with those of the other vaccinia-naive cohorts [Ref141:Greenberg et al., 2005].",,"U.S. government organizations have identified the need for a new smallpox vaccine to replenish limited stocks of the approved calf-lymph derived vaccine. Previous manufacturing methods using calf lymph are no longer acceptable because of the absence of controls in the process and the potential risk of contamination with the infectious agent associated with the prion disease bovine spongiform encephalitis. New manufacturing methods will need to eliminate the bovine intermediary. Because of ethical and safety considerations, challenge studies or field trials cannot be done to show efficacy. The strategy in designing the cell-cultured smallpox vaccine (CCSV) entailed selection of a well characterised isolate from a master vaccine seed stock used in the WHO eradication campaign. Methods of manufacture included consistency-validated processes for all aspects of manufacture, purification, storage, and distribution. Advantages of manufacture of this vaccine include the breadth of previous experience with well defined human diploid fetal lung fibroblasts in the production of other live, viral human vaccines, and the fact that the process is free from antimicrobial compounds that could produce reactions in sensitised individuals. The aims of this phase 1 clinical trial were to assess safety (frequency and severity of local and systemic adverse events), reactogenicity (frequency and characteristics of pock lesions), and immunogenicity (humoral and cellular immunity assays) of equivalent doses of CCSV and Dryvax in both vaccinia-naive and non-naive, healthy adult volunteers. Additionally, CCSV doses up to 50 times more dilute than the recommended dose for the Dryvax were assessed in a vaccinia-naive population [Ref141:Greenberg et al., 2005].",10,0,,,,,,

Candidate new-generation smallpox vaccines, such as MVA, produce very few adverse events in experimental animals and in limited human clinical trials conducted near the end of the smallpox eradication campaign. MVA was administered to more than 120,000 individuals in the latter stages of the smallpox eradication campaign without significant adverse events, although the thoroughness of safety data monitoring at that time is unclear. In addition to a vaccination strategy that employs multiple immunizations of MVA, alternative smallpox vaccination strategies may include an initial vaccination with non-replicating virus vaccine followed by a second immunization with a traditional replicating virus vaccine in order to reduce the possibility of vaccine-associate adverse events due to replicating vaccinia virus. Such a scheme of vaccination may be considered as a means of reducing the rate of adverse events associated with traditional smallpox vaccination, provided that vaccine efficacy is not compromised [Ref156:Meseda et al., 2005].",,"The aim of the present study was to compare the immunogenicity and protective ability of MVA (a leading candidate new-generation smallpox vaccine) to the licensed smallpox vaccine Dryvax in a mouse model of vaccination.

Several adverse cardiac events reported in the first 4 months of the 2003 civilian and military vaccination campaigns prompted the CDC to revise their recommendations for exclusion of potential smallpox recipients to include those persons with heart disease or several other conditions.

IgG ASC could be detected in the Mes LN of the DNA primed and especially of the adjuvanted groups. Moreover, although the presence of the F4R is required to induce IgA and IgM ASC in the Mes LN and other GALT of naÃ¯ve pigs following multiple oral F4 administrations, intestinal responses in DNA primed-orally boosted pigs were independent of the F4R status, suggesting an increased responsiveness of the parenterally primed animals to oral immunization.

BALB/c mice, 6â€“8 weeks old, were maintained under SPF conditions until the start of the bacterial challenge. Animals were immunized by either (1) intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections administered on days 0, 7 and 14; or (2) a mucosal regimen as previously described involving intra Peyer's patch (IPP) inoculation on day 0 and an intra tracheal (IT) boost on day 14 [20]. The peptides used in these studies were peptide 5 (T cell epitope) and the B + T peptide (Table 1). For i.p. immunization, the inoculum was prepared by emulsification with an equal volume of IFA such that each animal received either 20 Î¼g or 100 Î¼g of peptide per inoculation. For mice immunized by the mucosal regime, the inoculum for the IPP injections was prepared in IFA as for the i.p. immunizations except that the final inoculum concentrations for administration were 20 Î¼g/10 Î¼l and 100 Î¼g/10 Î¼l.

","Iss, the protein encoded by the iss gene, might be useful as an immunogen capable of eliciting a protective response against APEC infection in birds.

This widespread distribution of iss among APEC suggests that an Iss-based vaccine could provide broad protection to birds against heterologous APEC challenge. Computer analysis of Iss' predicted amino acid sequence has suggested that many portions of Iss are antigenic, and Iss is thought to be exposed on the bacterial surface in intact E. coli, meaning that it is accessible to the host's immune system.

These levels started to decrease by day 180, but were still detectable 10 months after the first immunization [Ref528:Arevalo-Herrera et al., 2005].",30,owl monkey (Aotus lemurinus griseimembra),"Male and female adult, malaria-naive Aotus monkeys were randomly allocated into two groups. An experimental group of six animals (group A) were immunized with the recombinant Pvs25 vaccine. A control group of three animals (group B) were immunized with adjuvant alone. Both groups were immunized on days 0, 60, and 120. Group A was inoculated with a total volume of 500 ÂµL of vaccine formulated as 100 Âµg of the Pvs25 recombinant protein in Montanide ISA-720 in a 7:3 antigen:adjuvant ratio. Group B was injected with distilled water containing no protein and mixed in the same adjuvant following the same procedure. The immunization was performed by the subcutaneous route distributed in five different sites of the thorax and abdomen of each animal [Ref528:Arevalo-Herrera et al., 2005].",,"","All monkeys developed patent parasitemia by day 453, approximately two weeks after intravenous challenge. The peak of parasitemia for most of the monkeys was observed between days 462 and 464 with parasitemias and ranged from 0.1% to 1.3% as determined by thin blood smear. Gametocytes were first evident between days 458 and 460 and remained at detectable levels in all animals until day 468. Plasma samples obtained on days 447, 462, 482, and 503 after parasite challenge were negative for antibodies directed to the Pvs25 recombinant protein by ELISA. Gametocytes that developed in both groups were infectious to mosquitoes as determined in an MFA conducted with monkey blood drawn on day 460 in which plasma from AB human control sera was replaced by sera from infected monkeys. This result supports the viability and functionality of the circulating gametocytes from both the Pvs25-immunized and the control animals.

Mosquitoes fed with P. vivax gametocyte-carrying human blood in the presence of either normal monkey plasma or normal AB human sera (negative controls) produced positive infections with an arithmetic mean of oocysts per midgut ranging between 0.3 and 3.8 and 0.2 and 1.0 oocysts, respectively. However, plasma from the Pvs25-immunized Aotus tested individually were highly inhibitory and completely blocked the development of oocysts, in all assays (reduction of the oocysts number > 98%) using three different P. vivax human isolates. Plasma from monkeys in the Montanide ISA-720 control group showed similar inhibition to the normal monkey plasma (negative control). Therefore, boosting of antibodies to Pvs25 is not caused by the parasite infection, this Pvs25 vaccine can be used as a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine [Ref528:Arevalo-Herrera et al., 2005].","No adverse side effects were encountered here [Ref528:Arevalo-Herrera et al., 2005].","Approximately 10 months after the last immunization (day 440) when specific antibodies to Pvs25 are no longer detected by ELISA, all monkeys were challenged with the P. vivax Salvador I strain by intravenous injection of 105 parasitized red blood cells. Total parasitemia and gametocytemia were followed every other day using thick and thin blood smears stained with Giemsa. Parasite concentrations were expressed as the number of gametocytes per microliter and the percentage of red blood cells parasitized by asexual parasite forms.19 Monkeys were bled post-challenge (days 447â€“503) to evaluate the presence of antibodies to Pvs25 by ELISA. In addition, the infectivity of circulating gametocytes was tested by feeding of An. albimanus mosquitoes with parasitized monkey red blood cells mixed with normal AB human sera using the MFA on days 460 [Ref528:Arevalo-Herrera et al., 2005].","",10,0,,,,,,

In vaccinated mice, challenge infection resulted in high levels of IL-10 production at all times tested. In contrast, in unvaccinated mice, IL-10 production reached levels comparable to that in the vaccinated mice beginning 6 days after infection. Previous studies indicate that both IL-10 and IFN- are produced following a B. abortus infection and that IL-10 induction does not down-regulate IFN- production. This implies that in brucellosis, the effect of IL-10 on the immune response is to limit the consequences of an exaggerated proinflammatory response more than to counterbalance the production of Th1 cytokines. These findings are in agreement with others which measured IL-10 production following Brucella infection [Ref897:Pasquali et al., 2001].","","At 42 days after vaccination, unvaccinated controls and IP vaccinated mice were challenged IP with 0.2 ml of saline containing 2 x 10^4 CFU of B. abortus 2308.

Spleen weights of mice vaccinated with live SRB51 or live SRB51+IL-12 were greater at 2, 4, 8, or 12 wpv when compared to saline controls, IL-12 controls, or mice receiving either vaccination treatment using killed SRB51.  Addition of exogenous IL-12 to culture supernatants of spleen cells obtained at 4 and 8 wk, but not at 2 or 12 wpv, enhanced lymphocyte proliferative responses of all vaccine treatments.  Maximal enhancement of lymphocyte response was associated with 
the addition of IL-12.  Mice vaccinated with live SRB51 (5 X 108 cfu) had lower spleen weights, total spleen cfu, and spleen cfu/g following challenge at 12 wk after vaccination when compared to mice receiving saline control, IL-12 control, or killed SRB51 treatments.  Administration of IL-12 as an adjuvant with live or killed SRB51 did not enhance resistance against experimental challenge with S2308 [Ref899:Lee et al., 1999].","","Mice (n = 10/treatment) were challenged IP with 2 X 10^4 cfu of S2308 at 12 weeks post-vaccination (wpv).  Blood samples and spleens were obtained from mice in all treatments after CO2/O2 euthanasia at 2, 4, 8, and 12 wpv (n = 5/treatment/time).  Following C02/02 euthanasia at 2 weeks after S2308 challenge (wpc), blood and spleens were obtained from mice in all treatments (n = 10/treatment).  Cells from 5 mice from each treatment were evaluated separately at 2, 4, 8, and 12 wpv.  Following S2308 challenge, spleen cell suspensions from 10 mice from each treatment were combined into 5 separate suspensions (2 mice/suspension, 5 suspensions/treatment) for evaluation of lymphocyte proliferative responses.

Female 10-week-old BALB/c AnNHsD mice were used in the following experiments.  Lyophilized SRB51 reconstituted in a 0.15 M NaCl saline solution was used to vaccinate PO by placing 20 ml of saline containing 5 x 10^8 or 5 x 10^6 CFU onto the pharyngeal mucosa.  Additional groups of mice were vaccinated IP with 0.2 ml of saline containing 5 x 10^8 or 5 x 10^6 CFU of SRB51.

Increased resistance to S2308 infection occurred at 12-20 weeks in mice vaccinated IP with SRB51 but occurred at 12 weeks only in mice vaccinated PO with 5 x 10^8 CFU SRB51 [Ref900:Stevens et al., 1996].","Neither route of vaccination induced anamnestic antibody responses to the surface antigens of intact S2308 bacteria after challenge infection of the vaccinated mice with S2308.  Mice vaccinated PO with SRB51 and challenged with S2308 at 12-20 weeks had lower and less persistent spleen cell proliferation and production of gamma interferon (IFN) in response to S2308 and certain immunodominant S2308 proteins (<18-32 kDa) than did mice vaccinated IP with SRB51.  However, mice had similar spleen cell tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) production.  These results indicate that PO vaccination of mice with SRB51 was effective in inducing protective immunity to S2308 infection, although the immunity was lower and less persistent than that induced by IP vaccination.  The lower protective immunity induced by oral vaccination may have resulted from lower and less persistent cell-mediated immunity and IFN production in response to S2308 and S2308 proteins [Ref900:Stevens et al., 1996].","","Nonvaccinated control mice and vaccinated mice at 12, 16, or 20 weeks after vaccination were challenged with S2308 by an IP injection of 2 x 10^4 CFU in 0.2 ml of 0.15 M NaCl saline solution [Ref900:Stevens et al., 1996].","",10,0,,,,,,

Although we detected CCHFV-specific IgM two-weeks after the first immunization (day 14 post-prime-vaccination (PV)), strong CCHFV-specific IgG responses were not detected until two-weeks after the second immunization (day 35 PV). We detected slight increases in CCHFV-specific IgG titers after the third immunization (day 56 PV). As expected, sham-vaccinated animals had no change in ELISA signal between pre-bleed (day 0 PV) and day 56 PV. We also evaluated whether the CCHFV-specific antibody response we detected in NP + GPC vaccinated animals by ELISA was neutralizing. Neutralization capacity of heat-inactivated serum collected at day 0 PV or on day 56 PV was evaluated by FRNT. Interestingly, despite high levels of antibody detected by ELISA, day 56 PV serum demonstrated poor neutralization activity against infectious CCHFV. In light of the high ELISA titers but poor serum neutralizing activity, we performed a sandwich ELISA to specifically measure NP or Gc-specific responses. Consistent with the poor neutralizing activity, we did not detect significant increases in Gc-specific antibody responses between day 0 and 56 PV. In contrast, significant increases between day 0 and 56 PV in NP-specific antibody responses were detected, suggesting the humoral response was largely directed against NP.

T-Cell Response:

Compared to sham-vaccinated animals, all NP + GPC vaccinated animals had detectable in vitro recall responses measured as IFNÎ³-producing SFCs to CCHFV-peptides, indicating the priming of CCHFV-specific T-cell responses by the vaccination. Recall responses against both NP and GPC-derived peptide pools were detected in all animals. Responses were equally distributed across NP. Across the GPC, we did not identify an immunodominant peptide pool although minimal responses were directed against N-terminal pools #1 or 2 or pool #7. Together, our ELISpot data demonstrate that NP + GPC vaccination induced CCHFV-specific IFNÎ³ recall responses against both vaccine antigens.",277,"","Twelve female Chinese-origin adult cynomolgus macaques, Macaca fascicularis, were used for this study. Six animals were vaccinated with two ubiquitin-antigen fusion plasmids, one encoding the CCHFV NP and the other the viral GPC, both derived from CCHFV strain Hoti. One milligram of each respective plasmid was delivered independently to opposing quadriceps. Six animals also received a sham-vaccination of an equivalent dose of plasmid encoding ubiquitin to each quadricep followed by in vivo electroporation. Animals received three identical vaccinations separated by three-week intervals. Blood draws were taken prior to vaccination and two-weeks after each vaccination.",,"","NP + GPC vaccinated animals had significantly reduced clinical signs of disease on day +6. When compared to baseline values obtained on day 0, we found that sham-vaccinated animals had significantly reduced platelets, total protein and albumin levels along with significantly elevated AST values at days 3, 5 and 6 PI. In contrast, these values in NP + GPC vaccinated animals remained largely unchanged from day 0 with slight decreases in albumin on days 3 and 6 PI and even significantly elevated platelets on day 6, although these values remained within normal ranges for NP + GPC vaccinated animals. These data demonstrate that NP + GPC vaccination prevents changes in blood chemistry that are often associated with poor outcome in human CCHF cases

To determine shedding of virus following CCHFV challenge, we evaluated viral RNA burdens in blood and oral and nasal swabs on days 0, 3, 5 and 6 PI. We found that NP + GPC vaccinated animals had no detectable viral RNA in the blood at any time point evaluated. In contrast, sham-vaccinated animals had significant levels of viral RNA at 3, 5- and 6-days PI. Similarly, NP + GPC vaccinated animals had no detectable viral RNA in the oral or nasal cavities whereas most sham-vaccinated animals had detectable viral RNA in these samples. Cumulatively, NP + GPC vaccinated animals had no detectable viral RNA in the blood, oral cavity or nasal cavity at any time point evaluated suggesting NP + GPC vaccinated animals exhibited robust control of the CCHFV challenge.","No serious adverse events were observed, and the most common side-effect observed during clinical exams following vaccinations was firmness at the vaccination site that resolved without intervention; this induration is expected after vaccination. In one animal, a lesion developed at the vaccination site, likely due to pruritis, but this too resolved without intervention.  Six animals had minor, one had moderate and one had severe myonecrosis and loss with histiocytosis with intracellular pigment at the vaccination site. These histologic lesions were limited to the immediate site of vaccination and at no time post-vaccination did any animals display clinical signs to indicate pain or discomfort associated with muscular lesions.","To date, infection of cynomolgus macaques has demonstrated that CCHFV infection results in a spectrum of disease outcomes from mild-to-moderate-to-severe disease, similar to the spectrum of disease seen in humans. Since the model is not uniformly lethal, we designed a study with a scheduled euthanasia at day 6 post-CCHFV infection to evaluate vaccine-mediated protection

To evaluate the protection afforded by NP + GPC vaccination, on day 0 relative to CCHFV challenge (post-infection (PI)) and day 63 PV, sham-vaccinated and NP + GPC-vaccinated animals were challenged with 100,000 TCID of CCHFV strain Hoti via simultaneous subcutaneous and intravenous injections.","",0,0,,"",,,,

2603,7,6073,"Vaccinemia: 
At 2 days postvaccination (DPV), the majority of vaccinated animals showed robust levels of RNA that loosely correlated with the dose level of vaccine administered. As expected, unvaccinated control animals exhibited no detectable levels of MARV GP RNA during the vaccination phase. With the exception of two guinea pigs, the three remaining vaccinated, non-surviving guinea pigs showed no detectable levels of MARV GP RNA postvaccination. By 27 DPV, MARV GP RNA was no longer detectable in any animal. 

Viremia:
MARV GP-specific RNA in the blood of animals was quantified via RT-qPCR. At 5 DPI, all control animals exhibited very high levels of MARV RNA in the blood, with an average of approximately 9â€“10 Log10 GEQ/mL, indicating abundant MARV replication concomitant with severe infection. Conversely, the majority of vaccinated animals exhibited no viral RNA in the blood at 5 DPI, suggesting that vaccine-elicited immunity prevented MARV replication. Indeed, all vaccinated groups of animals showed significantly lower mean MARV RNA levels compared with the control animals. 

Humoral Response:
The geometric mean endpoint titers for all vaccinated groups were significantly higher than that of the unvaccinated animals. Of the vaccinated, non-surviving guinea pigs, most had low or undetectable IgG endpoint titers, which exhibited moderate IgG levels. Pooling the data from the PHV01 MVS and FDS groups showed no significant difference in mean IgG titers between the medium and high dose levels, suggesting that both doses of vaccine elicited similarly robust immune responses. Moreover, logistic regression analysis comparing IgG endpoint titers and survival for all animals immunized with PHV01 MVS or FDS revealed a 90% probability of surviving infection with an IgG endpoint titer of 1600 (~Log10 3.2), which was achieved in almost all vaccinated animals from the medium- and high-dose groups. At 28 or 29 DPI (56 or 57 DPV), IgG endpoint titers increased to similar levels for all surviving animals, signifying an enhancement in the immune response to MARV following infection. 

Neutralizing Antibody Response:
Pooling the data from the clonal PHV01-vaccinated animals revealed that the high-dose groups had statistically significant higher geometric mean PRNT50 endpoint titers compared to both the control animals and the animals vaccinated with the medium dose. Together, these data suggest that immunization with PHV01 elicits a potent and dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response.
