7,Bacillus anthracis,1392,Anthrax,"Host ranges include the following:  livestock or other herbivores (eg, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, bison, water buffalo) acquire infection by consuming contaminated soil or feed; spores are infectious agents that can enter the human body through skin lesions, ingestion, or inhalation; and laboratory animal models include Guinea pigs, Syrian hamsters, and various mouse models [Ref115:PathPort].",G+ bacterium,VO_0012191,,VO_0010757,"In general, spores are phagocytosed by macrophages and germinate within phagolysosomes. Vegetative bacteria release many toxins leading to macrophage death. Lethal toxin acts on host macrophages and induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines responsible for inducing sudden and fatal shock [Ref15:Hanna et al., 1999]. Edema toxin causes localized edema and systemic shock [Ref16:Hirsh et al, 2004]. Other virulence factors allow for survival within phagolysosomes and on mucosal surfaces (Inh and MprF), escape from phagolysosomes and phagocytic cells (anthrolysins), iron acquiring products (Dlp), and regulation of cellular products (AtxA and AcpA) [Ref16:Hirsh et al, 2004].","Since protection against anthrax is induced by vaccines containing PA as the major immunogen, with minor amounts of EF and LF, antibodies against PA and other toxin components are essential in the protection against anthrax. Serum therapy has been used in the past for the treatment of human anthrax with some success. PA is a key immunogen for antianthrax vaccine development since it induces the production of toxin-neutralizing Abs. However, vital, anti-PA Abs are not the only, or completely sufficient, means for an immune host to impede the development of anthrax [Ref181:Glomski et al., 2007]. Immune serum containing antibodies to PA can be effective in the therapy of established experimental infection in guinea pigs. However, The identification of anti-toxic immunity as the most important means for protection against B. anthracis has been complicated by lack of an entirely well-accepted animal model for evaluating immunity to LeTx and to spores of different anthrax isolates, due to varying susceptibility of animal models to spores of different origin  [Ref19:Brey, 2005]. 

Anti-capsule antibodies may also be important in controlling the outgrowth phase of anthrax infection, since they would be presumed to fix complement and kill vegetative cells. However, antibodies to the poly Î³-d-glutamate capsule have not been well studied, because the capsule is poorly immunogenic and is a T cell-independent antigen. Recently, a series of murine monoclonal antibodies to the capsule has been obtained by immunizing mice with an anthrax capsule isoform isolated from B. licheniformis. The capsule is a major virulence factor in mice. Although there is a definitive role for anti-toxin antibodies in protection against anthrax, it is not yet clear what levels of antibodies will be required to protect humans against anthrax after vaccination or passive injection of protective antibodies. This consideration is important since challenge studies cannot be performed in humans, and correlates of immunity have to be extrapolated from animal studies [Ref19:Brey, 2005]. 

Humoral immunity does not protect from nontoxinogenic capsulated bacteria; however, a cellular immune response by IFN-{gamma}-producing CD4 T lymphocytes protect mice. These results provide evidence of protective cellular immunity against capsulated B. anthracis and suggest that future antianthrax vaccines should strive to augment cellular adaptive immunity [Ref181:Glomski et al., 2007].",+
8,Brucella spp.,234,Brucellosis,"Brucella has a broad host range infecting vertebrate animal species and humans. Brucella infections are most often identified in humans, cattle, swine, goats, sheep, deer, caribou, elk, dogs and coyotes. There are six Brucella species based on the preferential host specificity: B. melitensis (goats), B. abortus (cattle), B. suis (swine), B. canis (dogs), B. ovis (sheep) and B. neotomae (desert mice). The first four species are pathogenic and exhibit a decreasing order of severity in humans.  Therefore, brucellosis is a zoonotic disease [Ref410:Corbel, 1997]. Mouse models are often used in Brucella vaccine research. BALB/c and C57BL/10 mice differ in their abilities to induce immune responses and protection against virulent Brucella infections [Ref413:Fernandes et al., 1996] [Ref415:Li, 1991] [Ref414:Montaraz et al., 1986].",G- bacterium,VO_0012194,,VO_0010758,"The mechanism of Brucella pathogenesis and infection of natural animal hosts is not completely understood [Ref410:Corbel, 1997]. It is well accepted that its pathogenesis relies on its ability to live and replicate inside the vacuolar phagocytic compartment of macrophages [Ref412:Kohler et al., 2002]. The host macrophage-Brucella interaction is critical for establishment of chronic Brucella infections. The Type IV secretion system encoded by the virB operon and the two-component regulatory system encoded by the bvrRS operon are required for successful replication of Brucella in macrophages. Smooth Brucella strains with intact lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-side chains are virulent and invade macrophages through lipid rafts. On entry into the macrophage, Brucella reside in an acidified compartment that fuses with components of the early endosomal pathway. The majority of Brucella die at the early infection stage. A subpopulation of virulent Brucella strains is trafficked to an intracellular compartment known as the replicative phagosome (brucellosome) through continual interactions between the Brucella-containing vacuoles and the endoplasmic reticulum of the host macrophages. Once inside the replicative phagosome, Brucella are resistant to further attack and rapidly propagate. Virulent Brucella also inhibit macrophage apoptosis that in turn favors pathogen survival and replication. Brucella also infects placental trophoblast cells where acute infection leads to abortion and disease transmission [Ref411:Roop et al., 2004].","Both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses can influence the course of a Brucella infection, cell-mediated immune responses are essential for clearance of intracellular Brucella [Ref11:Schurig et al., 2002].

139,Streptococcus agalactiae,1311,Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection,"S. agalactiae colonizes in the body of some animals, including cow, sheep, and humans without causing any harm. The habitat of this microorganism is largely confined to the intestine and vagina in human and the mammary gland of cows and sheep. This microorganism also colonizes in the genital and/or intestinal tract of about 10-30% of pregnant women. However, some can actually cause diseases in their neonates or immunocompromised mammals.

141,Treponema pallidum,160,Syphilis,"T. pallidum is an obligate internal parasite, meaning that it requires a mammalian host for survival. In the absence of mammalian cells, T. pallidum will be killed by the absence of nutrients, exposure to oxygen and heat. T. pallidum causes the human disease syphilis. Since T. pallidum cannot be grown in culture, animal models are needed to study syphilis. Although mice and monkeys can be used, rabbits are the animal model almost exclusively studied in the lab. Rabbits are used because unlike monkeys they are inexpensive and unlike mice, rabbits develop the signs and symptoms of human primary and secondary syphilis [Ref1525:MicrobeWiki: T. pallidum].",G- bacterium,,,VO_0012358,"T. pallidum (in the case of syphilis) generally first forms a chancre at the site of infection and the spirochetes are infectious. The bacteria then penetrate mucosal membranes, and invade the bloodstream as well as other tissues. The bacteria cause latent syphilis which can progress into tertiary syphilis by the bacteria causing inflammatory disease and thus creating problems in infected [Ref1528:Salyers and Whitt., 2002].","The primary clearance mechanism responsible for removal of T. pallidum from syphilitic chancres is believed to be antibodyâ€mediated treponemal opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis and killing by macrophages [Ref1513:Cameron et al., 1998].",
11,Yersinia pestis,632,Plague,"Plague is primarily a zoonotic infection, occurring in urban or wild rodent populations.  Rodents that could be characterized as enzootic hosts (i.e., in what rodent populations Yersinia pestis is found naturally) have not been conclusively identified, but certain species of rat, vole, mouse, and gerbil are suspected [Ref49: Perry et al., 1997].",G- bacterium,VO_0012196,,VO_0010759,"The core of the Yersinia pestis pathogenicity machinery is the Yop virulon, encoded on the 70-kb plasmid of pathogenic Yersinia species.  The Yop virulon consists of three basic components: the Ysc injectisome (an organelle which spans the bacterial membrane), the Yop effectors, and the Yop translocators that are involved in delivering the effectors across the eukaryotic plasma membrane.  Once injected, Yop proteins perturb the dynamics of the cytoskeleton (disrupting phagocytosis) and block the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus favoring the survival of Yersinia pestis while inducing apoptosis in the macrophage.  The Yop virulon is an archetype of the type III secretion system now identified in more than a dozen major animal or plant pathogens [Ref47: Cornelis, 2002]. ","To clear Yersinia infection, the host must develop a strong adaptive immune response, and IFN-Î³-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells are essential in this process [Ref178:Heesemann et al., 2006].  The anti-YresiniaV antigen antibody-mediated neutralization of Yersinia-induced macrophage cytotoxicity correlates with in vivo protection [Ref179:Bashaw et al., 2007]. Humoral antibody response also plays a major role in mediating protection as demonstrated by passive transfer of anti-deF1 DNA antiserum [Ref180:Grosfeld et al., 2003].

Young birds at around two to eight weeks of age that have highly active bursa of Fabricius are more susceptible to disease. Birds over eight weeks are resistant to challenge and will not show clinical signs unless infected by highly virulent strains.
After ingestion, the virus destroys the lymphoid follicles in the bursa of Fabricius as well as the circulating B-cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues such as GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue), CALT (conjunctiva), BALT (Bronchial) cecal tonsils, Harderian gland, etc. Acute disease and death is due to the necrotizing effect of these viruses on the host tissue. If the bird survives and recovers from this phase of the disease, they remain immunocompromised which means they are more susceptible to other diseases and vaccination in the face of outbreak will not be effective [Ref1570:Wiki: Infectious Bursal Disease].","Passive immunity protects against disease, as does previous infection with avirulent strains.

147,Piscirickettsia salmonis,1238,"Salmon Rickettsial Disease, Piscirickettsiosis","The transmission of P. salmonis in natural infections is horizontal or fish-to-fish and no vector is required. The reservoir for the bacterium is unknown but may include one or more species of fish or other aquatic animals. The principal hosts for P. salmonis are salmonid fish. Coho salmon was the species involved in the first recorded outbreaks of piscirickettsiosis in Chile. The disease has also been reported in rainbow trout, cherry salmon, Oncorhynchus masou (Walbaum), and Atlantic salmon in Chile [Ref1571:Fryer and Hedrick, 2003].",G- bacterium,,,,"Microscopic lesions caused by P. salmonis in naturally acquired infections can be found in numerous organs and tissues characteristic of a systemic or septicaemic condition. Although the sequential development of the naturally acquired infections has not been reported, initial infections presumably commence when the physical barriers of the skin and/or gills are breached by the bacterium (Almendras et al. 1997; Smith, Pizarro, Ojeda, Contreras, Oyanedel & Larenas 1999). Replication of the bacterium results in raised discoloured areas on the skin that may then progress to shallow ulcers, as observed under field conditions and following experimental applications of the bacterium with filter paper patches to the skin (Smith, Contreras, Larenas, Aguillon, GarcÃ©s, Perez & Fryer 1997). Direct dispersion of the bacterial suspension onto the gills also initiates local infections that spread via the blood (haematogenous) and then via major vessels to the parenchyma of numerous organs (Almendras et al. 1997). A serosal spread of the bacterium is more characteristic of infections induced by intraperitoneal injections of the bacterium. In injected fish, the capsules of the major organs in the peritoneum are sites of replication prior to invasion of the parenchyma (Almendras et al. 1997). In the later stages of infection the internal and microscopic pathological changes observed in fish exposed via different routes become similar, most likely because septicaemia eventually occurs even in cases of the serosal spread of the bacterium (Cvitanich et al. 1991). The septic nature of infections is demonstrated by the presence of infected macrophages visible in blood smears from heavily infected fish (Cvitanich et al. 1991) [Ref1571:Fryer and Hedrick, 2003].","The immune response of salmonids to P. salmonis infections remains poorly understood, but more recent studies, including successful laboratory vaccine trials, provide optimism for this approach to control of the disease.

CAV infection has adverse effects on proliferative responses of spleen lymphocytes and on the production of interleukin-2 and interferons by splenocytes.

The virus replicates mainly in the oral and respiratory tissues, although some strains vary in their tissue tropisms and pathogenicity, such that virus has also been found in visceral tissues, feces and occasionally in urine. The significance of this to transmission is unknown but is thought to be minimal. Oral ulceration is the most consistent pathological feature of FCV-induced oral and upper respiratory tract disease. Ulcers begin as vesicles, typically on the margin of the tongue but also in other locations. These subsequently rupture, with necrosis of the overlying epithelium and infiltration of neutrophils at the periphery and base. Healing generally takes place over a period of two to three weeks. Pulmonary lesions occur more rarely and appear to result from an initial focal alveolitis, leading to areas of acute exudative pneumonia and then to the development of a proliferative, interstitial pneumonia. Lesions seen in joints of cats with FCV associated lameness consist of an acute synovitis with thickening of the synovial membrane and an increase in quantity of synovial fluid within the joint. FCV can also cause systemic disease [Ref1579:Radford et al., 2007].","The immune response has a somewhat limited impact on FCV infection. It is clear that pre-existing immunity, acquired either naturally as maternal-derived antibodies (MDA) or artificially following vaccination, can reduce or eliminate the clinical signs of subsequent FCV challenge.

Viraemia is highly cell associated and may be prolonged but not persistent in domestic ruminants. BTV promiscuously associates with all blood cells during viraemia, thus titres of virus in each cell fraction are proportionate to the numbers of each cell type; specifically, BTV is quantitatively associated most with platelets and erythrocytes and, because of the short lifespan of platelets, virus is largely or exclusively associated with erythrocytes late in the course of BTV infection of ruminants.

Human disease occurs throughout the northern hemisphere [Ref46:Isherwood et al., 2005].",G- bacterium,VO_0012198,,VO_0010760,"There are two types of F. tularensis; Type A is the most virulent causing an often fatal disease while Type B is less virulent and therefore causes a milder form of disease. The species are classified into four distinct sub-species.  F. tularensis subspecies tularensis comprises all the strains previously classified as Type A.   F. tularensis subspecies holarctica comprises those strains classically referred to as Type B.  F. tularensis subspecies mediaasiatica comprises Central Asian strains. The fourth subspecies, F. tularensis subspecies novicida, is a very infrequent cause of human disease, although F. novicida is able to cause a lethal infection in the murine model of disease [Ref46:Isherwood et al., 2005].","While antibody develops against both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and protein antigens, the role of antibody in protection depends on the nature of the challenge strain. In the murine model of disease, immunization with LPS is able to provide antibody-mediated protection against an otherwise lethal intradermal or intraperitoneal challenge with F. tularensis subspecies holarctica. However, similarly immunized mice are only partially protected against an airborne challenge with F. tularensis subspecies holarctica. When challenged with the most virulent strains of F. tularensis (subspecies tularensis) by any routes, there is at best evidence only of a slight delay in the time to death.  

Cellular immunity is likely to play the main role in protection against tularemia. In mice challenged with F. tularensis LVS, neither CD4+ nor CD8+ T cells appear to be absolutely required for control of the infection, but either cell type can promote clearance of the challenge. However, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells appear to be required for the clearance of a challenge with F. tularensis subspecies tularensis. The clearance of F. tularensis is likely due to the Th1-related cytokines TNFÎ±, IFNÎ³, and IL-12. 

Overall,  protection against tularemia is likely to be dependent on the induction of antibody, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune responses. The induction of all of these responses appears to be necessary for protection and effective clearance of the most virulent strains [Ref46:Isherwood et al., 2005].",-
13,Ebola virus,205488,Ebola hemorrhagic fever,"The natural host for Ebola virus is unknown [Ref76:Sullivan et al., 2003]. ",virus,VO_0012199,,VO_0010761,"Mononuclear phagocytes are the first targets of infection relevant to disease pathogenesis, followed by connective tissues and parenchymal cells. Cytokines are released when reticuloendothelial cells encounter virus, which can contribute to exaggerated nonprotective inflammatory responses. Ebola virus GP plays a vital role in infection. Virual GP appears to form a trimeric complex and binds preferentially to endothelial cells Infection of endothelial cells also induces a cytopathic effect and damage to the endothelial barrier that, together with cytokine effects, leads to the loss of vascular integrity. Cytokine dysregulation and virus infection may synergize at the endothelial surface, promoting hemorrhage and vasomotor collapse. Severity of infection is influenced by age, immune status, and viral virulence. Infection with species-adapted viruses may be lethal. The amount and location of fibin deposits varies with animal species. Strains show differing levels of virulence both across species and by route of administration. Microvascular damage and activation of the clotting cascade occurs. Death is secondary to massive cell death, fluid shifts, hemorrhages, and vascular abnormalities [Ref76:Sullivan et al., 2003a].","Both adaptive and innate inflammatory systems respond to infection [Ref76:Sullivan et al., 2003a]. Although antibody titres correlate with the protective response, many studies in non-human primates have suggested that the passive transfer of antibody is insufficient to provide long-lasting protection against Ebola virus [Ref77:Sullivan et al., 2003b]. In rodent studies with adapted Ebola virus, passive transfer of antibodies or adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T cells showed protection when given before infection. A more sensitive but less quantitative CD4 lympho-proliferative response correlated with protection in a DNA/ADV primeâ€“boost study. In addition to the antibody response induced by an effective vaccine, both CD4 and CD8 responses were observed after the challenge. The fact that CD4 responses were not observed before challenge whereas CD8 responses were more consistently seen beforehand suggests that the CD8 response is likely to have an important role in protection in non-human primates [Ref77:Sullivan et al., 2003b].

Specifically, botulinum toxin types A and E target a protein known as SNAP-25, and toxin types B, D, F, and G target the protein VAMP/synaptobrevin. Toxin C targets both SNAP-25 and syntaxin. Target protein cleavage significantly disrupts release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In its native state, this neurotoxin is bound to nontoxic proteins, which greatly enhances toxin molecular stability. Botulinum toxin introduced into the body (potentially by a number of mechanisms but most commonly by absorption from the gastrointestinal tract) is carried throughout the body by the bloodstream. Toxin binds to nerve-ending receptors, becomes internalized within the neuron, and causes an irreversible blockade of cholinergic transmission at the following sites: all ganglionic synapses, all postganglionic parasympathetic synapses, and all neuromuscular junctions. The far-reaching results at these sites include widespread flaccid paralysis and potentially devastating autonomic nervous system perturbations [Ref101:PathPort].","Inhibition of BoNT action at any of the key steps of the BoNT pathogenesis process outlined above could abolish the onset of botulism. Protective antibody immune response against specific BoNT toxin types is required to protect against different BoNT toxin types in botulism infections.

Pathogenesis involves initial replication at the site of infection. Lymph node, lung, and other parenchymal organs are important sites of viral growth. Interstitial infiltrates and edema occur during infection, and the macrophage is early and prominently involved. Many epithelial structures contain antigen and nucleic acids, with widespread marginal zone infection and splenic lymphoid follicle necrosis are common findings [Ref132:Botten et al., 2006].","Detectable neutralizing antibodies are absent during acute Lassa virus infection. Low-titer neutralizing antibodies may appear several weeks to months after the resolution of infection. Treatment of LF patients with immune plasma does not protect against disease. These observations strongly suggest that antibody response is not important, instead, cell-mediated immunity is critical for protection against LASV infection in humans. LASV-specific CD4+ T cells have been found in convalescent patients, and CD8+ T-cell response is the main determinant responsible for providing protection against LASV infection  [Ref132:Botten et al., 2006].",n
18,Variola virus,10255,Smallpox,"Variola virus is considered to be a host-restricted poxvirus, with humans as the reservoir host and no zoonotic hosts known.  However, the virus does replicate well in most mammalian cell cultures [Ref153:McFadden, 2005].",virus,VO_0012200,,VO_0010764,"Smallpox is a viral disease unique to humans. To sustain itself, the virus must pass from person to person in a continuing chain of infection and is spread by inhalation of air droplets or aerosols. There are three principal routes of viral infection corresponding to the three principal surfaces of the body: the respiratory tract, the alimentary tract, and the skin. Minor routes of infection include the urinary and genital tracts and the conjunctiva. Although congenital infection occasionally occurred in smallpox, it was of no epidemiologic importance. The infectious dose is unknown but is believed to be only a few virions [Ref150:Henderson, 1999].
It is assumed to be low, 10 to 100 organisms [Ref151:Franz et al., 1997]. 
Variola is most effectively spread via the respiratory route with as little as ten plaque-forming units contained within aerosolized saliva able to transmit the infection from person to person [Ref152:Hassett, 2003].
Variola virus is highly stable and retains its infectivity for long periods outside the host. It is infectious by aerosol, but natural airborne spread to other than close contacts is controversial. Approximately 30% of susceptible contacts became infected during the era of endemic smallpox, and the WHO eradication campaign was predicated on close person-to-person proximity being required for transmission to occur reliably. Nevertheless, variola virus's potential in low relative humidity for airborne dissemination was alarming in two hospital outbreaks. On natural exposure to aerosolized virus, variola travels from the upper or the lower respiratory tract to regional lymph nodes, where it replicates and gives rise to viremia, which is followed soon thereafter by a rash [Ref134:PathPort].","Both cellular and humoral immune response are important in protection against smallpox. In mouse models of vaccinia infection, extensive studies have shown that passive immunotherapy with immune serum or monoclonal antibodies are protective. Antiviral antibody could protect mice efficiently even if CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted prior to challenge. However, in B-cell-deficient or MHC II-deficient mice, which are unable to elicit effective antibody responses, strong antiviral T-cell responses played an important role in protecting against disease following viral challenge. Studies using non-human primates infected with lethal monkeypox showed that the smallpox vaccine-induced antibody responses were both necessary and sufficient for protection against lethal monkeypox infection. In humans, cellular immunity played the most important role in protective immunity in humans against  primary poxvirus infections based on the severe complications following smallpox vaccination of children with genetic T-cell deficiencies. Following vaccination, strong antiviral antibody responses are likely to be the main effector mechanism responsible for protection against secondary infection [Ref182:Amanna et al., 2006]. ",n

The primary risk factors associated with Campylobacter infection are consuming and handling foods of animal origins, especially poultry products. In addition to epidemiological evidence, microbiological evidence supports poultry as the primary source of human Campylobacter infection [Ref201:Nelson et al., 2007]. The majority of Campylobacter-associated infections are thought to be sporadic cases of food poisoning; contaminated drinking water, including that from public water supplies, is the vehicle of large Campylobacter-associated outbreaks. Although Campylobacter spp. are widely distributed in the environment, the epidemiology of many cases of Campylobacter-associated infections remains unclear [Ref202:Abulreesh et al., 2006]. After incubation of approximately three days, abrupt cramping pain in the abdomen is followed by diarrhea. The mechanism of diarrhea induction is a complex and multifactorial process. The diarrheal stage lasts a few days. Complications are rare, but infection may be followed by the development of reactive arthritis or GBS. 

Flagella-mediated motility has been shown to be necessary for Campylobacter to colonize the intestinal tract, and experimental infections in humans and animals, and in vitro analyses of adherence and invasion in cultured human cells have demonstrated that cell invasiveness is necessary in Campylobacter-induced inflammatory diarrhea. Several bacterial components have been shown to have adhesive properties (LPS, flagella, fimbrial filaments, surface-exposed proteins), and a direct role of toxins including of cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) in disease remains to be demonstrated. Host factors are of importance in the pathogenesis of GBS following a Campylobacter infection. It is now clear that specific bacterial genes are crucial for the induction of anti-ganglioside antibodies [Ref203:Engberg, 2006].","Anti-flagellar serum antibody titres of the dams did not correlate with protection of their young [Ref570:Dolby et al., 1986]. There was a good correlation between high campylobacter-specific IgG response and bactericidal activity. The degree of protection conferred by vaccinated dams on infant mice against colonization by Campylobacter jejuni depended on the bacterial strain, preparation, and route of administration of the vaccine. In some instances of homologous protection, serum bactericidal titres correlated well with protection. However, boiled C. jejuni vaccine, which was non-protective, also elicited a strong bactericidal antibody response. Conversely, bactericidal activity could not be demonstrated against strains capable of cross-protection.  [Ref571:Abimiku et al., 1989].",-
25,Escherichia coli,83334,Hemorrhagic colitis,"Direct links between E. coli O157:H7 in cattle and human infections have been confirmed by bacterial isolation and by the presence of serum antibodies against O157 and Shiga-toxin (Stx) antigens in dairy farm families and their cattle. Cattle are believed to be a major conduit for the passage of E. coli O157:H7 into the food supply, but other animals also shed this microorganism in their feces [Ref200:Pathport]. For this reason, neonatal calves are often used as an animal model in testing EHEC vaccines, as well as gnotobiotic piglets. However, since EPEC is host specific and dpes not induce diarrhea in animals, the pathology of the infection is imitated in animal hosts through the use of specially-adapted veterinary pathogens, such as REPEC (rabbit enteropathogenic E. coli) and RDEC (rabbit diarrheal E. coli). Both of these strains elicit the A/E lesions needed to study the vaccine [Ref669:Horne et al., 2002].",G- bacterium,VO_0012201,,VO_0010766,"E. coli O157:H7 can be transmitted by food and water. Infection by E. coli O157:H7 is most commonly caused by the consumption of undercooked, contaminated ground beef or beef products, also caused by contaminated drinking or recreational water, raw milk, and person to person contact. The infection mechanisms by which E. coli O157:H7 causes haemorrhagic colitis and HUS are not fully understood. E. coli O157:H7 is believed to adhere closely to mucosal cells of the large bowel, disrupting the brush border. This adherence is completed through the utilization of a Type IV fimbriae bundle-forming pilus between the E. coli and the intestinal epithelial cells.The adherence can progress to a more intimate attatchment resulting in the formation of A/E lesions [Ref669:Horne et al., 2002]. This process alone may be sufficient to produce non-bloody diarrhoea. Shiga toxins have both local and systemic effects on the intestine and are probably critical to the development of bloody diarrhoea. Shiga toxin (Stx) binds to globotriaoxylceramide receptors (Gb3) on cells in the vascular system and in the kidneys. Interaction with the Gb3 receptor leads to internalization of the toxin, which results in the inhibition of protein synthesis [Ref669:Horne et al., 2002].   Histopathological changes associated with infection include haemorrhage and oedema in the lamina propria with areas of superficial focal necrosis. Beef products still account for most of the E. coli O157:H7 cases; however, other food like salad vegetables, fruits, alfalfa and radish sprouts, unpasteurized apple cider, mayonnaise, yogurt, and salami have also been implicated in recent major outbreaks [Ref200:Pathport].","Possible future treatments for E. coli O157:H7 infection include orally administered shiga toxin-binding resins and toxin-neutralising antibodies. Natural infection with E. coli O157:H7 does not confer immunity, and no human vaccine is currently available [Ref200:Pathport]. Major advances in the production of the vaccine can be made once a better understanding of mucosal immunology is complete. DNA-based vaccination is also a possibility to develope protective immunity against EHEC and EPEC. Construction of these vaccines expressing multiple virulence genes of the pathogen could be effective in producing long-term immune response [Ref669:Horne et al., 2002].",-

Two-thirds of HIV/AIDS infections in Asia occur in India, with an estimated 6 million infections, surpassing South Africa's 5.5 million infections, making India the country with the highest number of HIV infections in the world [Ref224:Palella et al., 1998].",virus,VO_0012203,,VO_0010767,"The 3 major routes of HIV transmission are sexual intercourse, contaminated needles, and transmission from an infected mother to her baby at birth, or through breast milk. HIV primarily infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. This decreases CD4+ T cells through direct viral killing of infected cells, increased rates of apoptosis in infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections [Ref236:Chan et al., 1997].","HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on target cells and also with chemokine coreceptors. Macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4+ cells become depleted in the patient. T-tropic isolates, or syncitia-inducing (SI) strains replicate in primary CD4+ T cells as well as in macrophages. Dual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of the HIV-1 virus. HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels [Ref236:Chan et al., 1997][Ref237:Coakley et al., 2005][Ref238:Deng et al., 1996][Ref239:Knight et al., 1990].",n

",virus,VO_0012225,,VO_0010769,"   The initial targets of infection are generally macrophages, monocytes, and DCs. Filoviruses generally bind to the TREM or C-type lectin receptors on myloid cells. However, since some cells do not express C-lectin or TREM receptors, viral entry may be due to molecules such as heparin-sulphate proteoglycan and folate receptor-Î±. Data also indicate that the expression of TLR1 (whose signal converges with that of TLR2) was increased on MARV-activated neutrophils [Ref622:Mohamadzadeh et al., 2007]. 
","Filoviruses have been found to disable some of the host IFN pathway, such as the VP35, which prevents the production of type I IFNs, and VP24, which interferes with the abilities of certain molecules to induce antiviral states. IFN is crucial to immune response, as indicated by elevated levels of IFN in the blood even during acute infection. It had also been seen that there is a deficit (virus-induced) in the co-stimulatory properties of infected Dcs, identified by a supressed capacity of the DCs to stimulate allogenic T cells.  By affecting either viral exit or entry, cellular proteases could influence viral cellular tropisms and interactions between antibodies and glycoproteins. All host protective immunity observations are also tied with the prevalence of an abundance of cathepsins [Ref622:Mohamadzadeh et al., 2007].

The most predominant animal used to study M. tuberculosis for virulence assessment and vaccine development is likely the mouse, which include C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains, mainly due to cost effectiveness for long-term vaccination/challenge studies.  Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs are often used in M. tuberculosis studies as a close model for the overall pathogenesis in humans.",G+ bacterium,VO_0012195,,VO_0010770,"Mouse and guinea pig models have been used extensively to understand the host and pathogen-specific factors controlling pathogenesis of tuberculosis.  Transmission of M. tuberculosis via intravenous route in murine models is followed by initial bacterial replication and subsequent macrophage activation via IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-mediated mechanisms.  Bacterial load is significantly reduced at 2 weeks post-infection in liver and spleen.  After load reduction, selected lymphocytes are activated which can then induce macrophages to begin producing nitric oxide via the iNOS pathway.  Bacteria which survive the initial clearance by the host enter a viable yet non-replicating persistence stage.  Factors such as immune suppression from aging, iNOS inhibition, and corticosteroid therapy can shift the dormant bacilli back into a replicative state.  As an example of preferred host niche, transmission via inhalation will sometimes result in bacilli establishing infection in macrophage phagosomes in the lung.  These macrophages become lodged in the calcified tubercles, and can later initiate formation of granulomas through a CD4-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.  Each granuloma can remain dormant, reduce in size and possibly disappear, initiate progressive interstitial fibrosis in lung tissue, and/or necrotize [Ref327:Ernst et al., 2007].  Similar mechanisms are observed in liver tissue [Ref550:Ducati et al., 2006].
Numerous pathogen- and host-specific factors related to pathogenesis of tuberculosis are potential vaccine targets.  For example, the Bacille-Calmette Guiren (BCG) vaccine was obtained from an M. bovine strain which lost its virulence after 39 passages [Ref550:Ducati et al., 2006].  Evidence from subtractive hybridization experiments, along with whole-genome microarrays and BAC arrays and other experimental evidence, suggests that the RD1 locus is the main virulence feature that is absent from 13 strains of avirulent BCG yet present in hundreds of other M. tuberculosis strains [Ref327:Ernst et al., 2007].  RD1 is related to the regulation of the early secreted antigen 6 kDa [ESAT-6] secretion system 1[ESX-1], an important pathway which is linked to the recruitment and infection of macrophages to initially infected sites and subsequent disease propagation  [Ref327:Ernst et al., 2007].","Although it is known that IFN-gamma is essential for protective immunity, animal and human studies have found that IFN-gamma alone is not sufficient for the prevention of TB disease. There is evidence that IL-23, a recently described member of the IL-12 family of cytokines, is important in the immuno-pathogenesis of TB. There is also evidence that regulatory T cells (Treg) are present in TB disease and that Treg may suppress effector T cell responses [Ref234:Fletcher, 2007].  New vaccines seek to target specific CD1, CD4+, and CD8+ T and B cell responses to assist in eradicating the disease via improved clearance of infected cells and bacterial loads.",n
30,Plasmodium spp.,5820,Malaria,"The vast majority of malaria cases occur in children under the age of 5 years; pregnant women are also especially vulnerable. Despite efforts to reduce transmission and increase treatment, there has been little change in which areas are at risk of this disease since 1992. Precise statistics are unknown, as the majority of cases are undocumented. Although HIV/malaria co-infection produces less severe symptoms than the interaction between HIV and TB, HIV and malaria do contribute to each other's spread. This effect comes from malaria increasing viral load and HIV infection increasing a person's susceptibility to malaria infection. Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; however, it is in sub-Saharan Africa where 85â€“ 90% of malaria fatalities occur. The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex, and malarial and malaria-free areas are often found close to each other. In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall [Ref247:Breman, 2001][Ref248:Greenwood et al., 2005][Ref249:Hay et al., 2004].",parasite,VO_0012207,,VO_0010771,"Malaria in humans develops via exoerythrocytic (hepatic) and erythrocytic phases. When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver. Within 30 minutes of being introduced into the human host, they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 6â€“15 d. During this ""dormant"" time in the liver, the sporozoites are often referred to as ""hypnozoites"". Once in the liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells, thus beginning the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell. Within the erythrocytes, the parasites multiply further, periodically breaking out of their hosts to invade fresh erythrocytes. Several such amplification cycles occur, resulting in the classical waves of fever. Some merozoites turn into male and female gametocytes. If a mosquito pierces the skin of an infected person, it potentially picks up gametocytes within the blood. Fertilization and sexual recombination of the parasite occurs in the mosquito's gut, thereby defining the mosquito as the definitive host of the disease. New sporozoites develop and travel to the mosquito's salivary gland, completing the cycle. Pregnant women are especially attractive to the mosquitoes, and malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of stillbirths, infant mortality and low birth weight [Ref244:Talman et al., 2004][Ref245:Bledsoe, 2005][Ref246:Sturm et al., 2006].","Plasmodia are relatively protected from attack by the body's immune system because for most of its life cycle it resides within liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, P. falciparum displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen and giving rise to hemorrhagic complications. Endothelial venules can be blocked by the attachment of masses of these infected red blood cells (RBCs). The blockage of these vessels causes placental and cerebral malaria. Although the RBC surface adhesive proteins (called PfEMP1, for Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) are exposed to the immune system, they do not serve as good immune targets because of their extreme diversity; there are at least 60 variations of the protein within a single parasite and perhaps limitless versions within parasite populations [Ref250:Chen et al., 2000][Ref251:Adams et al., 2002].",?
31,Haemophilus influenzae,727,Meningitis,"H. influenzae live exclusively in humans, and although they may cause disease in a variety of body sites (such as the central nervous system, joints, skin, lungs, bronchi and genito-urinary tract), they are most commonly isolated from the nasopharynx, where they are carried asymptomatically . Throat or nasopharyngeal culture surveys of both healthy and ill individuals reveal the carriage rate to be between 20 and 85%, and the majority of colonizing strains lack a capsule. Person to person transmission of H. influenzae is assumed to occur by contact with infected respiratory droplets and has resulted in clusters of H. influenzae type b (Hib) invasive infections among children in households and day care centers [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].

The infant rat model of invasive Hib disease played a substantial role in the identification of Hib virulence factors. The model allows for respiratory tract colonization in rats less than three weeks of age by inhalation of only a few organisms. Colonization is followed closely by bacteremia and meningitis. Therefore, this model mimics the invasive disease seen in children . Older rats (up to three months of age) can also develop meningitis through intraperitoneal injection of Hib and subsequent bacteremia. Rabbits have also been used for experimental Hib infections and have contributed to understanding the pathophysiology of meningitis and in the design of treatment regiments. Rabbits require direct inoculation into the CNS or the perturbation of the CNS prior to i.v. injection [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].

Experimental infection studies for otitis media most often employ the chinchilla but the gerbil and rat have also been used . In the chinchilla, NTHi are often inoculated directly into the bulla and disease is monitored over a two- to eight-week period for fluid pressure changes using otoscopy and tympanometry. Tympanocentesis and nasopharyngeal lavage are performed to assess colonization and immune responses present in the middle ear . Direct inoculation of the middle ear results in 100% infectivity but bacterial and host factors involved in initial nasopharyngeal colonization cannot be studied through this route. While NTHi can colonize the nasopharynx of chinchillas after experimental inoculation, colonization does not consistently lead to otitis media. An otitis media model has, however, been developed that allows for initial colonization with NTHi. Chinchillas are first infected with adenovirus, and then NTHi, administered nasally, will colonize the nasopharynx and sometimes result in otitis media. This scenario mimics development of otitis media in children. This method has been used to assess the role of bacterial components in colonization and their potential as vaccine candidates .

Pulmonary infection models used for vaccine efficacy tests have utilized both mice and rats. In these models, animals are immunized intravenously or at the mucosal surface and then challenged by direct administration of NTHi to the lungs. Bacterial clearance is then assessed a few hours after challenge by culturing homogenized lung tissue or lavage fluid. These pulmonary clearance models, however, do not allow for the study of persistent colonization as is seen with chronic infections in the lungs of adults with COPD. Attempts have been made to reflect this scenario in rats by administering NTHi encapsulated within agarose beads. This method can lead to infections that persist for weeks resulting in pathology and immune responses that parallel those seen in humans .",G- bacterium,VO_0012204,,VO_0010772,"The most important virulence factor defining pathogenic H. influenzae strains is capsule, of which six serotypes, a-f, have been described. Among encapsulated strains, those possessing the type b capsule (Hib strains), which is composed of polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), are the most virulent, capable of causing sustained bacteremia and subsequent focal infection in non-immune, normal hosts. Like the capsules of other gram negative organisms, H. influenzae capsules enhance the pathogenicity of the bacteria by protecting them from phagocytosis. The strong negative charge of the polysaccharide capsules may provide electrostatic repulsion to phagocytic cells and the capsular material itself may sterically interfere with the binding of opsonizing antibodies and complement to the bacterial surface [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].

H. influenzae pili (sometimes called fimbriae) was the first well studied adherence factors of H. influenzae. These filamentous organelles are seen by electron microscopy distributed in a peritrichous manner on the H. influenzae bacterial cell surface of isolates that hemagglutinate and adhere to buccal epithelial cells, but are absent from non-hemagglutinating and non-adherent bacteria. Generally strains isolated from invasive infections do not express pili, while those colonizing the nasopharynx more commonly do. piliated H. influenzae binds to erythrocytes possessing the Anton (AnWj) antigen. Additional studies have shown that sialic acid-containing lactosylceramides, the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3 and GD1a, inhibit pilus- mediated H. influenzae binding to both buccal epithelial cells and erythrocytes [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].

Highly similar high-molecular-weight proteins (HMW1, HMW2) were first identified as H. influenzae-associated antigens by their ability to induce robust antibody responses in individuals with acute otitis media . Subsequent studies have revealed that these HMW proteins function as adherence factors and can facilitate the colonization of cultured human epithelial cells . HMW1 is a 160 kDa product of the hmw1A gene and HMW2 is a 155 kDa protein encoded by the hmw2A gene; hmw1A and hmw2A are 71% identical and 80% similar . To date the hmw genes have only been detected in nontypable strains, and a majority of HMW-positive strains retain both chromosomal loci [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001]. 

Secretory IgA fulfills many protective functions on the mucosal surface; these include the neutralization of toxins, inhibition of pathogen attachment to the epithelium, and agglutination of organisms within mucus . To surmount this immunological obstacle, H. influenzae constitutively secrete IgA1 proteases which are enzymes that inactivate the predominant IgA species, IgA1, by cleaving the immunoglobulin molecule at the heavy chain hinge region, resulting in the production of two fragments (Fab and Fc). [Ref256:Reinholdt et al., 1997]

H. influenzae produces a lipopolysaccharide structure that lacks an O-specific antigen and, instead, incorporates short oligosaccharide side chains onto three conserved heptoses and is thus termed lipooligosaccharide (LOS). A wide variety of glyco-modifications to the core LOS molecule have been detected and include the addition of glucose, galactose, lactose, phosphatidylcholine (ChoP), and sialic acid. This repertoire of sugars allows the organism to mimic common eukaryotic glycolipid structures, and is presumably an adaptive strategy for subverting immune defenses [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].","Newborns are protected by transplacental maternal type b antibodies and older children and adults are protected by ""natural antibodies"", which are H. influenzae specific antibodies in a host who has not had a known H. influenzae infection. Most likely these antibodies result from subclinical infection or asymptomatic colonization [Ref255:Talan et al., 1999].",-
37,Coxiella burnetii,777,Q fever,"Several species are infected by C. burnetii. However, the disease seems to be more severe in human beings [Ref592:Waag, 2007]. C. burnetii has also been found to cause abortions in humans, goats, sheeps, and cattles [Ref606:Langley et al., 2003][Ref607:Palmer et al., 1983][Ref608:Waldhalm et al., 1978]. C. burnetii can be cultured and isolated using chicken embryo yolk sacs. Model organisms normally use for infection research include mice and guinea pigs, and sheeps [Ref609:Williams and Thompson, 1991].",G- bacterium,,,VO_0010773,"C. burnetii is found in large numbers in birth fluids of goat and cows [Ref610:Stoker and Marmion, 1955]. Humans are then infected by inhaling from the infected aerosols or dust particles with the contaminated birth fluids. Approximately only 10 microorganisms are needed to infect humans [Ref596:Tigertt et al., 1961]. Based on animal models, C. burnetii is first engulfed by macrophages after inital infection in the lungs [Ref593:Burton et al., 1971][Ref594:Burton et al., 1978]. The microorganism grows within the acidic environment, with a pH around 4.7 - 4.8 [Ref597:Ohkuma and Poole, 1978], in the phagolysosome and eventually rupture the host cells and infect other neighboring cells [Ref598:Hackstadt and Williams, 1981] [Ref593:Burton et al., 1971]. C. burnetii suppresses the host immune responses and avoids host cell activation (avoid recognition by TLR). As a result, the microogranism is able to persist within phagolysosome [Ref611:Zamboni et al., 2004][Ref612:Shannon et al., 2005].","Antibodies produced by the immune system is not the primary mechanism used for resistance. Studies have shown that the activation of monocytes and macrophages by gamma interferon results in the production of active nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. This mechanism results in the killing of C. burnetii [Ref613:Brennan et al., 2004][Ref614:Turco et al., 1984]. However, C. burnetii minimizes detection by the host cell, thereby minimizes the killing by the intermediates (see Microbial Pathogensis for more information).",-
32,VEE Virus,11036,Venezuelan equine encephalitis,"VEE causes encephalitis in a wide range of vertebrate animals including humans, horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, dogs, bats, rodents, and some birds. Rodents have been frequently used in the laboratory for VEEV pathogenesis and vaccine studies. VEEV is also an arthropod-borne virus and can infect and replicate in mosquito [Ref331:Weaver et al., 2004]. ",virus,,,VO_0010774,"In equines and humans, VEEV causes inapparent to acute encephalitis. Enzootic VEE strains in subtypes I-E, II, III, and IV are avirulent for equines and generally produce only low titered viremia and little or no illness. However, at least some of the enzootic viruses can be pathogenic for humans and have caused fatal disease. The incubation period in human VEEV infection is usually 2â€“5 days. VEE occurs in all human age groups without sex bias. Children are more likely to develop fatal encephalitis than adults. VEEV also causes birth defects, abortions and stillbirths in pregnant women. In experimentally infected equines and rodents, VEEV causes severe myeloid depletion in bone marrow and lymphocyte destruction in lymph, nodes and spleen. Encephalitis is accompanied by a wide range of histopathology, from mild neutrophilic infiltration to neuronal degeneration, necrotizing vasculitis, and Purkinje cell destruction. In mice, VEEV appears to reach the brain via the olfactory nerve, seeded by viremia [Ref331:Weaver et al., 2004].

VEEV encodes four nonstructural proteins (nsP1â€“4) and three structural proteins: the capsid and the E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins. The E2 protein forms spikes on the surface of the virion. The E1 protein lies adjacent to the host cellâ€“derived lipid envelope. VEEV can use the laminin binding protein as a receptor for entry into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. After fusion of virions with the membrane of endosomes at low pH via a hydrophobic amino acid sequence in the E1 protein, the genome is translated in the cytoplasm to generate the nonstructural polyprotein.  Viral genome replication occurs on the cytoplasmic surface of endosomes. One molecule of genomic RNA interacts in the cytoplasm with 240 copies of the capsid protein to form a nucleocapsid. The envelope glycoproteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and interact with nucleocapsids at the plasma membrane to initiate budding of virus particles on the surface of cells [Ref331:Weaver et al., 2004].

Biological transmission of arthropod-borne VEEV involves initial infection of the mosquito midgut following ingestion of a viremic blood meal. Posterior midgut epithelial cells become infected first, followed by dissemination into the hemocoel and infection of secondary organs and tissues including the salivary glands. Virus maturation (budding) in midgut epithelial cells occurs exclusively on the basal margins adjacent to the basal lamina [Ref331:Weaver et al., 2004].

The epizootic transmission cycle of VEEV actively involves equines as highly efficient amplification hosts. Although the vertebrate host range of epizootic VEEV strains is wide and includes humans, sheep, dogs, bats, rodents, and some birds, major epidemics in the absence of equine cases have never occurred despite the repeated occurrence of epizootics near major cities such as Maracaibo [Ref331:Weaver et al., 2004].

Sylvatic rodents in the genera Sigmodon, Oryzomys, Zygodontomys, Heteromys, Peromyscus, and Proechimys are believed to be the principal reservoir hosts of most enzootic VEE complex viruses. They are frequently infected in nature. They also have high rates of immunity and develop moderate to high titered viremia [Ref331:Weaver et al., 2004].","Cell-mediated immunity plays a predominant role in protection against VEEV. Immunity resulting from inactivated VEEV vaccines is short-lived and frequent boosters are required to maintain protection. Inactivated VEEV vaccines generate protective neutralizing immunity only after multiple inoculations [Ref331:Weaver et al., 2004].  ",n
41,Clostridium tetani,1485,Tetanus,,G+ bacterium,VO_0012220,,VO_0010775,"C. tetani typically enters a host through a wound. C. tetani produces two exotoxins, tetanolysin and tetanospasmin. Eleven strains of C. tetani have been identified, which differ primarily in flagellar antigens and in its ability to produce tetanospasmin. All toxigenic strains contain a plasmid that produces identical toxins. Tetanospasmin is a neurotoxin, one of the most potent toxins known. Tetanospasmin causes the clinical manifestations of tetanus. Tetanospasmin is distributed in the blood and lymphatic system. The toxin enters the nerve axon, transports across synaptic junctions, and finally reaches the central nervous system. It  is then rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic junctions of inhibitory motor nerve endings. The tetanus toxin blocks inhibitory impulses by interfering with the release of neurotransmitters, including glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. The clinical manifestations of tetanus include unopposed muscle contraction and spasm [Ref711:Brook, 2008].",,+
42,Salmonella spp.,590,Salmonellosis,"S. Typhi only causes infections in humans. S.  Typhimurium causes a lethal disease in susceptible mice which resembles in many aspects of human typoid fever. Therefore, S.  Typhimurium has been frequently used as a model to study human typhoid fever. S. enterica causes zoonotic gastrointestinal infections from reservoirs in all important livestock animals. Vaccine studies have been done on humans, cattle, mice, and chickens [Ref633:Boyle et al., 2007] [Ref633:Boyle et al., 2007].",G- bacterium,VO_0012215,,VO_0010776,"Salmonella first replicates in epithelial cells. It generally targets dendritic cells and macrophages after the mucosal barrier, where it multiplies rapidly [Ref632:Cheminay and Hensel, 2007]. Salmonella infections induce a weak and delayed T cell responses in human typhoid fever and in animal models of typhoid fever, suggesting immunosuppressive effects. Salmonella also directly inhibits T cell proliferations [Ref632:Cheminay and Hensel, 2007].  ","Little information exists regarding the protective immunity and immunological memory for serovar Typhi. B-cell production of soluble antibodies, cytotoxic T lymphocyte activities for killing infected cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell homing to the gut, and distinct subsets of memory T cells are shown to be essential for protective immunity against serovar Typhi infection [Ref633:Boyle et al., 2007].  Two vaccines are currently commercially available against typhoid. Typhim Vi (Pasteur Merieux) is a vaccine of purified Vi-antigen from S. Typhi. Vivotif is a live attenuated S. Typhi Ty21 strain, generated by the mutagenesis of the virulent, parental S. Typhi Ty2. The major challenge of vaccine development is balancing immunogenicity and attenuation. Many vaccines have been developed with mutations in regulatory genes encoding adenylate cyclase and cAMP receptor protien [Ref632:Cheminay and Hensel, 2007].",-
43,Shigella,620,Shigellosis,"Humans are the only natural host for Shigella, but NHP have also been used in vaccine trials [Ref648:Niyogi, 2005]. ",G- bacterium,VO_0012208,,VO_0010777,"Infection is generally limited to the intestinal mucosa and involves a possible enterotoxic or cytoxic diarrhoeal prodrome, cytokine-mediated inflammation of the colon, and necrosis of the colonic epithelium. This inflammation is caused by the invasion of Shigella into the colonic epithelium and the lamina propria. Shigella can enter both M cells and enterocytes, reorganizing the cytoskeleton, beginning with the type II secretion system. The colitis and ulceration of the mucosa result in febrile diarrhoea and/or bloody, mucoid stools [Ref648:Niyogi, 2005].

Shigella strains produce three distinct enterotoxins: 
(i) chromosome encoded shigella enterotoxin 1 (SHET1) which is present in all S. flexneri 2a but rarely found in other shigella serotypes. This toxin is enterotoxic, neurotoxic, and cytoxic, with a structure simlilar to the Shiga-like toxins of enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli infection. The toxin is not essential for virulence, but does contribute  to the severity of disease manifestations. Also, this toxin adheres to the small intestine receptors and blocks electrolyte, glucose, and amino acid absorption from the intestinal lumen. The B subunit of this toxin binds host cell glycolipid in the large intestine, A1 domain internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and  causes irreversible inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis, causing cell death, microvasculature damage to the intestine, and haemorrhage.  
(ii) shigella enterotoxin 2 (SHET2), which is located on a large plasmid associated with the virulence of shigella. SHET2 was found in many shigella of different serotypes and also in enteroinvasive E. coli.  
Inactivation of SHET1 and SHET2 through genetic engineering is used for attenuation of new shigella vaccine candidates.
(iii) phage-born Shiga toxin by S. dysenteriae [Ref648:Niyogi, 2005].

","Wild type Shigella infection induces protective immunity, which develops after repeated exposure during childhood. This immunity is serotype specific (e.g., directed to the LPS O antigen of this organism). Shigella antigen specific antibody response develops early in infection and follows the typical course for anti-LPS antibodies, that is, an IgM response that peaks within weeks of exposure and wanes after 1-2 year [Ref648:Niyogi, 2005].",-

Those with impaired immunity may be easier to get meningococcus. Meningococcal virulence is related to both capsule expression, expression of other surface structures, and underlying genotype. N meningitidis pathogenesis is related to its ability to express and modify capsule with serogroups A, B, C, W-135, X, and Y. Capsules of N meningitidis facilitate transmission and colonisation, and protect the meningococcus from desiccation, phagocytic killing, opsonisation, and complement-mediated bactericidal killing. Outer membrane proteins (e.g., PorB, PorA , Opa and Opc) contribute to meningococcal virulence. Outer membrane porins are involved in host-cell interactions and as targets for bactericidal antibodies. Endotoxin, or lipo-oligosaccharide, a major component of the outer membrane, differs in structure from enteric endotoxins and is crucial in inflammatory signalling via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [Ref713:Stephens et al., 2007].","N. mengingitidis establishes systemic infections only in individuals who lack serum bacterial antibodies directed against the capsular or noncapsular (cell wall) antigens of the invading strain, or in patients deficient in the late-acting complement components. The presence of serum bactericidal IgG and IgM is probably the most important host factor in preventing invasive disease. The role of bactericidal antibodies in prevention of invasive disease explains why high attack rates are seen in infants from 6 to 9 months old, the time at which maternal antibodies are being lost. Individuals with complement deficiencies (C5, C6, C7, or C8) may develop meningococcemia despite protective antibody. This emphasizes the importance of the complement system in defense against meningococcal disease [Ref1544:Textbook of Bacteriology].",-

It attaches to nasopharyngeal cells through interaction of bacterial surface adhesins. It can cause otitis media or sinusitis if it enters areas such as the Eustachian tube or nasal sinuses. Pneumonia occurs if the organisms are inhaled into the lungs and not eliminated. S. pneumoniae can activate complement, stimulate cytokine production, and attracts neutrophils and other white blood cells. The organism's polysaccharide capsule makes it resistant to phagocytosis. S. pneumoniae can spread to other areas and cause various diseases. S. pneumoniae has several virulence factors, including the polysaccharide capsule, pneumococcal surface proteins, and IgA1 protease [Ref715:Wiki: S. pneumoniae].","The bacteria invade and grow primarily due to their resistance to the host phagocytic response.

SLAM is expressed on immature thymocytes, activated lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. It regulates production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by CD4+ T cells, as well as production of IL-12, tumour necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide by macrophages. The distribution of SLAM is in accord with the lymphotropism and immunosuppressive nature of MV [Ref724:Yanagi et al., 2006].","Although innate responses probably contribute to control of virus replication during the incubation period, the onset of clinically apparent disease coincides with the appearance of MV-specific adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses.

It exists as an elementary body (EB) in between hosts. The EB is not biologically active but is resistant to environmental stresses and can survive outside of a host for a limited time. The EB travels from an infected person to the lungs of a non-infected person in small droplets and is responsible for infection. Once in the lungs, the EB is taken up by cells in a pouch called an endosome by a process called phagocytosis. However, the EB is not destroyed by fusion with lysosomes as is typical for phagocytosed material. Instead, it transforms into a reticulate body and begins to replicate within the endosome. The reticulate bodies must utilize some of the host's cellular machinery to complete its replication. The reticulate bodies then convert back to elementary bodies and are released back into the lung, often after causing the death of the host cell. The EBs are thereafter able to infect new cells, either in the same organism or in a new host. Thus, the life cycle of C. pneumoniae is divided between the elementary body, which is able to infect new hosts but can not replicate, and the reticulate body ,which replicates but is not able to cause new infection [Ref1428:Wiki: Chlamydophila pneumoniae].",,-

Cutaneous diphtheria can be caused by both the toxigenic and the nontoxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae. Cutaneous diphtheria presents as nondescript sores or shallow ulcers on the skin, and is usually mild and treatable. Only 1-2% of cutaneous cases become toxigenic. Respiratory diphtheria is caused by C. diphtheriae bacteria adhering to and colonizing the tonsils, nasal cavity, and throat. Mechanisms of adherence are unknown, but recent research suggests that proteins SpaB and SpaC found on two minor pili play an important role in specifically binding to pharyngeal cells. A visible, leathery pseudomembrane forms over the surface of the cells, especially the tonsils and throat. A lesion develops and plasma from injured epithelial cells leaks into the lesion, producing a fibrin network infused with C. diphtheriae. Symptoms present themselves 2-5 days after infection with C. diphtheriae. Initially, symptoms include a sore throat and low fever. More severe symptoms include inflammation of the neck and difficulty breathing or asphyxiation [Ref1551:MicrobeWiki: C. diphtheriae].","Acquired immunity to diphtheria is due primarily to toxin-neutralizing antibody (antitoxin). Passive immunity in utero is acquired transplacentally and can last at most 1 or 2 years after birth. In areas where diphtheria is endemic and mass immunization is not practiced, most young children are highly susceptible to infection. Probably, active immunity can be produced by a mild or inapparent infection in infants who retain some maternal immunity, and in adults infected with strains of low virulence (inapparent infections) [Ref1552:Textbook of Bacteriology].",+

However, as PCV2 is found in cells that lack GAGs, it is thought that another coreceptor is also used for viral entry. The hallmark lesion of PCV2 infection is lymphoid depletion with histiocytic replacement. In affected lymph organs, dendritic cells, and macrophages that replace the lymphocytes contain large amounts of PCV2 virus. There is no viral degradation in these cells, and because dendritic cells are highly mobile, it is thought that dendritic mobility may be a method of viral dissemination in tissues. It is still unknown how PCV2 causes a reduction in lymphocytes. Hypotheses include induced apoptosis, decreased lymphocyte production in the bone marrow, or reduced lymphocyte proliferation in secondary lymphoid tissue [Ref1542:Gillespie et al., 2009].","Because most breeding age sows are seropositive for PCV2, most piglets are born with maternal antibodies against PCV2. In weaned piglets, the mean half life of antibodies is 19 days. Antibody levels will wane at 4â€“6 weeks in pigs with initially low levels of antibody, at 6â€“10 weeks with moderate antibody levels, and by 8.5â€“13.5 weeks in pigs with high antibody levels. Piglets do not typically demonstrate clinical signs of disease before 4 weeks of age, suggesting that maternally derived antibodies are protective. Experimental studies found that maternal antibody protection is dependent on the level of maternal antibodies present. High levels of maternal antibodies are more protective than low levels, but do not completely prevent infection, whereas low levels of antibodies did not provide any protection against infection [Ref1542:Gillespie et al., 2009].",n

A second glycoprotein, glycoprotein D (gD), binds specifically to at least one of three known entry receptors. These include herpesvirus entry mediator(HVEM), nectin-1 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate. The receptor provides a strong, fixed attachment to the host cell. These interactions bring the membrane surfaces into mutual proximity and allow for other glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope to interact with other cell surface molecules. HSVs may persist in a quiescent but persistent form known as latent infection, notably in neural ganglia. HSV-1 tends to reside in the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 tends to reside in the sacral ganglia, but note that these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior [Ref1434:Wiki: Herpes simplex virus].","HSV evades the immune system through interference with MHC class I presentation of antigen on the cell surface. This is achieved through blockade of the TAP transporter induced by the secretion of ICP-47 by HSV. TAP maintains the integrity of the MHC class I molecule before it is transported via the golgi apparatus for recognition by CD8+ CTLs on the cell surface. ICP-47 disrupts this integrity, preventing the capture of cytosolic proteins for CTL recognition and thus evades CTL destruction [Ref1434:Wiki: Herpes simplex virus].",

Pathogenesis follows a complex set of interactions between many factors triggered by the host's innate and acquired immune responses (eg, macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells). These inflammatory responses mediate disease expression and may result in either symptomless or subclinical infection, self-healing LCL, or chronic leishmaniasis (eg, DCL, mucosal leishmaniasis, leishmaniasis recidivans). Clinical cure ensues when macrophages become activated to a leishmanicidal state.
When biting their hosts, infected sandflies regurgitate leishmania promastigotes into the skin, which invade or are phagocytosed by local or recruited host cells, mainly macrophages. Within the phagolysosomes of resident macrophages, promastigotes become amastigotes. Amastigotes replicate and may then infect additional macrophages, either locally or in distant tissues after dissemination. When blood-feeding on an infected host, naive sandflies become infected with amastigotes, which transform back into promastigotes in the sandfly's gut (depending on Leishmania spp, different regions of the gut will be parasitised. The parasites then migrate to the sandfly's proboscis, thus completing the leishmania life cycle [Ref1547:Reithinger et al., 2007].","The immune response to Leishmania infection is cell-mediated, and the clinical outcome is dependent on host-mediated T helper (Th)1 or Th2 responses. A Th1 response mediated by interferon (IFN)-Î³, tumour necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-12 is associated with disease resolution and resistance, and a Th2 IL-4-producing response confers disease susceptibility and progression [Ref1546:Ameen, 2010].",

The immune responses induced against L. (L.) amazonensis have showed a distinct pattern from that described for L. (L.) major. While mice that are resistant or susceptible to infection with L.

Findings from several studies in experimental models of T cruzi infection have suggested that a strong T-helper-1 immune response with both CD4 and CD8 cells, and characterised by the production of some specific cytokinesâ€”such as interferon Î³, tumour necrosis factor Î±, and interleukin 12â€”is important in the control of parasitism. By comparison, production of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor Î² is related to parasite replication by inhibition of macrophage trypanocidal activity. The T-helper-1 immune response has a protective role mainly through the synthesis of nitric oxide, which exerts a potent trypanocidal action. During chronic infection, the balance between immune-mediated parasite containment and damaging inflammation of the host tissues probably determines the course of disease. If the immunological response is inefficient, or paradoxically leads to tissue damage, both parasite load and immune-mediated inflammation increase. By contrast, a well executed immune response, in which parasite burden is lowered and inflammatory consequences are kept to a minimum, results in reduced tissue damage [Ref1356:Rassi et al., 2010].",,

The EB travels from an infected bird to the lungs of an uninfected bird or person in small droplets, and is responsible for infection. Once in the lungs, the EB is taken up by cells in a pouch called an endosome by a process called phagocytosis. However, the EB is not destroyed by fusion with lysosomes, as is typical for phagocytosed material. Instead, it transforms into a reticulate body and begins to replicate within the endosome. The reticulate bodies must use some of the host's cellular machinery to complete its replication.

184,Porcine rotavirus,10913,Diarrhea,Pigs,virus,,,,"Gut mucosal infection occurs primarily by the invasion route via viral replication at the tips of the villi of epithelial cells in the small intestine, leading to structural and functional changes in the epithelium. The diarrhea that results is caused by the multiple activities of the virus. Malabsorption is a generally accepted mechanism of rotavirus-induced diarrhea, which is characterized by viral replication in villus enterocytes in the small intestine, with subsequent cell lysis and attendant villus blunting, depressed level of mucosal disaccharidase, watery diarrhea, and dehydration. The rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP4, which has recently been suggested to have a toxin-like function, may participate in inducing intestinal inflammation [Ref1620:Li et al., 2010].","Because rotaviruses are enteric pathogens, gut mucosal immune responses are likely to play an important role in protective immunity against rotavirus infection. Gut innate immunity provides the first line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms and also initiates acquired immune responses [Ref1620:Li et al., 2010].",

However, in young pigs, the mortality rate is close to 100% [Ref1627:Wiki: Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus].",virus,,,,"The pathology of TGEV is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Coronaviruses enter the host by first attaching to the host cell using the spike glycoprotein. The S protein interacts with the procine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a cellular receptor, to aide in its entry. The same cell receptor is also a point of contact for Human Coronaviruses. A domain in the S spike protein is recognized by pAPN, and transfection of pAPN occurs to nonpermissive cells and infects them with TGEV. Once the virus infects the host, it multiplies in the cell lining of the small intestine resulting in the loss of absorptive cells that in turn leads to shortening of villi. The infected swine then has reduced capability for digesting food and die from dehydration [Ref1627:Wiki: Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus].",,
