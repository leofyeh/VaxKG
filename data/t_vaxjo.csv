18,"Interleukin-12 is composed of two disulfide-linked subunits with molecular weights of 40 kDa (p40) and 35 kDa (p35). The human p35 and p40 subunits are structurally unrelated and have been mapped to chromosomes 3p12â€“3q13.2 and 5q31â€“q33, respectively. Cells require co-expression of both genes to secrete biologically active IL-12. IL-12 is primarily produced by phagocytic cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC) such as monocytes, DC and activated B lymphocytes, and production is strongly stimulated by infectious pathogens and their products. The other important stimuli for IL-12 synthesis are interactions between CD40 and its ligand (CD154), on APC and B cells or T cells, respectively [Ref1733:Portielje et al., 2003].","In the vaccination area, IL-12 activates innate immune cells and promotes production of cytokines and chemokines, thereby mediating the attraction of other innate as well as specific immune cells to this region. We hypothesize that the co-administration of tumor antigens together with the strong pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 provides the environment with inflammatory danger signals required to activate antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) and prevents tolerance induction towards the tumor antigens. In addition, IL-12 directs the development of T-helper lymphocytes towards the type 1 (Th1) functional profile that promotes cellular immune responses and stimulates the proliferation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and thereby the establishment of immune memory [Ref1733:Portielje et al., 2003].","Mice were given IL-12 adjuvant at 0.5 mg [Ref1732:Rao et al., 1996].","Clinical experience in humans is still limited.

Titermax adjuvant protect the antigen from rapid degradation (Allison, 1979; Osebold, 1982). This depot effect prolongs the exposure of antigens to the hostâ€™s immune system. The use of deposit agents, oils (paraffin oil for FCA and squalene for TM, respec- tively), facilitates enhanced macrophage phagocytosis. Immune stimulation and augmentation of antigen processing are achieved by killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in FCA, and the block copolymer in TM (Hunter et al., 1989).

More recently, the induction of cell-mediated immune response to poorly immunogenic protein and peptide antigens has been made possible through the use of positively charged liposome carriers. Although these vesicles alone are relatively nonimmunogenic, their adjuvant potency toward the associated antigen is due in part to the efficient delivery of the antigen to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and dendritic cells. It is well established that liposomes channel protein and peptide antigens into the major histocompatibility complex class II pathways of APCs, resulting in enhanced antibody and antigen-specific T-cell proliferative response. In addition, there have been reports of the use of cationic liposomes for the generation of CD8+ T-cell response, which requires antigen presentation in the context of the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway [Ref1764:Bhowmick et al., 2008].","BALB/c mice were immunized by three intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections at 2-week intervals with graded doses entrapped in liposomes (200 Âµl) [Ref1764:Bhowmick et al., 2008].","Till date, liposomal vaccines against various diseases, such as cancer, HIV, Hepatitis B and malaria, have been investigated and found to be safe.
